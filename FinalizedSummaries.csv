1,Genomic map of the functionally extinct northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni),Biophysics and computational biology,"The northern white rhinoceros (NWR; Ceratotherium simum cottoni) is functionally extinct, with only two nonreproductive females remaining alive. Extraordinary measures are underway to rescue this species, including using a collection of NWR induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate gametes for assisted reproduction technologies. Because of the critical importance of genomic integrity in germ cells used for reproduction, these approaches require extensive genomic analyses to exclude aberrations that are acquired during culture of iPSCs. In order to support those efforts, we have generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of northern white rhinoceros and used this reference genome to evaluate the genomic integrity of iPSCs cultured for the generation of artificial gametes.","The northern white rhinoceros (NWR; Ceratotherium simum cottoni) is functionally extinct, with only two nonreproductive females alive. Efforts to rescue the NWR from its inevitable demise have inspired the exploration of unconventional conservation methods, including the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the in vitro generation of artificial gametes. The integrity of iPSC genomes is critical for in vitro gametogenesis to be used for assisted reproductive technologies using NWR iPSCs. We generated a chromosome-level NWR reference genome that meets or exceeds the metrics proposed by the Vertebrate Genome Project, using complementary sequencing and mapping methods. The genome represents 40 autosomes, an X and a partially resolved Y chromosome, and the mitochondrial genome. Using comparative FISH mapping, we confirmed a general gene order conservation between the NWR and horse genomes. We aligned the NWR genome with that of the southern white rhinoceros (SWR; Ceratotherium simum simum), a population that has been physically separated from the NWR for tens of thousands of years, and we found that the two subspecies are very similar on the chromosome level. Comparing long-read data from NWR iPSC lines and the fibroblast cultures used for reprogramming, we identified copy number variations that were likely to have been introduced during in vitro iPSC expansion. The NWR reference genome allows for efficient, rapid, and accurate assessment of the genomic integrity of iPSC lines to direct their differentiation. This will assist in strategies to rescue the NWR through extraordinary measures like cloning and the generation of embryos from iPSC-derived gametes."
2,Global diversity and energy of animals shaping the Earth’s surface,Environmental sciences,"Animals profoundly influence Earth surface processes and landforms, but their collective significance has not been quantified. Integrating data across freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, we uncovered over 600 animals with reported geomorphic effects, including five livestock taxa. Many more are doubtless overlooked due to inherent geographical and taxonomic biases in published research. We conservatively estimate that wild animal species collectively contribute ≈76,000 GJ energy or more to geomorphic processes annually, equivalent to the energy expended by hundreds of thousands of extreme floods. Livestock acting as geomorphic agents are estimated to exceed this contribution by three orders of magnitude. Our results reveal that the energy of animal geomorphic agents is a significant and overlooked driver of landscape change at the global level.","The collective influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth’s surface remains largely unknown, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. To establish the global geomorphic significance of animals, we systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence across freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Over 600 animal taxa had reported geomorphic effects. For the 495 wild animals and 5 livestock identified to species level, we estimated their global abundance, and collective biomass and energy. While our census is global in scope, a lack of research in the tropics and subtropics, and on less visible animals, leaves them underrepresented in analyses. Most reported species are globally widespread, but some are rare, endemic, and/or threatened, leading to risks that key geomorphic processes cease before we fully understand them. We estimate the collective biomass in wild animal geomorphic agents at ≈0.2 Mt Carbon, equating to a biological energy content of ≈7.6 million GJ. If a conservative minimum 1% of this energy contributes to geomorphic work annually, this yields an energy contribution from wild animal geomorphic agents of ≈76,000 GJ—equivalent to the energy of hundreds of thousands of extreme floods. Uncertainties in biomass estimates and energy partitioning mean this value could credibly be an order of magnitude higher, and countless species remain unreported or undiscovered. The livestock estimates exceed the wild animals estimates by three orders of magnitude. The geomorphic energy of animals is far more influential than previously recognized and future losses, dispersal and introductions of zoogeomorphic species may induce substantive landscape changes."
3,Multiple sclerosis and gut microbiota: Lachnospiraceae from the ileum of MS twins trigger MS-like disease in germfree transgenic mice—An unbiased functional study,Immunology and inflammation,"We developed a strategy to identify gut bacteria functionally linked to the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). To minimize confounders, we analyzed microbiota composition in a large cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for MS and identified over 50 differently abundant taxa. We then sampled microbiota from the ileum of selected twins, and, in order to functionally characterize them, we introduced them into germfree TCR-transgenic mice prone to develop MS-like disease upon bacterial colonization. We found that MS-derived ileal microbiota induced disease at higher rates than analogous material from healthy twin donors. Our results implicate two Lachnospiraceae members, namely Eisenbergiella tayi and Lachnoclostridium, as likely responsible for an increased incidence of disease.","We developed a two-tiered strategy aiming to identify gut bacteria functionally linked to the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). First, we compared gut microbial profiles in a cohort of 81 monozygotic twins discordant for MS. This approach allowed to minimize confounding effects by genetic and early environmental factors and identified over 50 differently abundant taxa with the majority of increased taxa within the Firmicutes. These included taxa previously described to be associated with MS (Anaerotruncus colihominis and Eisenbergiella tayi), along with newly identified taxa, such as Copromonas and Acutalibacter. Second, we interrogated the intestinal habitat and functional impact of individual taxa on the development of MS-like disease. In an exploratory approach, we enteroscopically sampled microbiota from different gut segments of selected twin pairs and compared their compositional profiles. To assess their functional potential, samples were orally transferred into germfree transgenic mice prone to develop spontaneous MS-like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) upon bacterial colonization. We found that MS-derived ileal microbiota induced EAE at substantially higher rates than analogous material from healthy twin donors. Furthermore, female mice were more susceptible to disease development than males. The likely active organisms were identified as Eisenbergiella tayi and Lachnoclostridium, members of the Lachnospiraceae family. Our results identify potentially disease-facilitating bacteria sampled from the ileum of MS affected twins. The experimental strategy may pave the way to functionally understand the role of gut microbiota in initiation of MS."
4,Independent effects of the human circadian system and sleep/eating cycles on caloric intake in adolescents vary by weight status,Neuroscience,"Using an experimental protocol designed to disentangle the separate influences of the endogenous circadian timing system and the sleep/wake and fasting/eating cycle, we found that both the endogenous circadian timing system and behavioral cycle influence caloric intake. Youth with overweight or obesity compared to those with healthy weight ate more of their calories later in the circadian evening and those with obesity ate more calories later in the wake episode. Youth with overweight or obesity also showed a lower amplitude of the circadian influence on caloric intake.","Late-day eating is linked to increased obesity risk; however, whether the endogenous circadian system independently influences caloric intake and if this control differs among individuals based on weight status is unknown. Here, we investigated in adolescents the independent roles of the endogenous circadian system and of the behavioral sleep/wake cycle (sleep/wake, fasting/eating, rest/activity, dark/dim light, social interaction, posture, etc.) on self-selected caloric intake using a Forced Desynchrony protocol. Fifty-one male and female adolescents across three weight status categories (24 with healthy weight, 13 with overweight, and 14 with obesity) completed the protocol where participants lived on seven 28-h sleep/wake cycles in dim light during wake and complete darkness during sleep. Results suggest that the circadian system and the behavioral cycle each affected caloric intake, with a decrease across the wake episode and an increase from circadian morning to circadian evening in caloric intake. The endogenous circadian rhythm in caloric intake showed a circadian peak-to-trough difference of 196 [CI 95% 164, 226] kcal per meal with peak timing of 296° [288°, 304°; equivalent to ~17:30 in these participants]. In those with overweight/obesity, more calories were consumed later in the waking episode and later in the circadian cycle, and with blunted amplitudes compared to those with healthy weight. Results implicate both the endogenous circadian system and the behavioral cycle in shaping the daily rhythm of food intake. Furthermore, these results help explain the increased drive for caloric intake toward the evening, especially in those at risk for obesity."
5,Increased flood exposure in the Pacific Northwest following earthquake-driven subsidence and sea-level rise,"Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","In coastal flood hazard analysis, local factors like land subsidence from great earthquakes (>M8) are often overlooked. Along the Cascadia subduction zone (Washington to northern California), the next great earthquake will likely cause 0.5 to 2 m of sudden subsidence and associated sea-level rise, dramatically expanding coastal floodplains. Earthquake deformation modeling and geospatial analysis show that subsidence from a great earthquake at Cascadia today could double the flood exposure of residents, structures, and roads. By 2100, earthquake subsidence amplified by projected climate-driven sea-level rise could more than triple the flood exposure of residents, structures, and roads. This study underscores the need to consider combined earthquake and climate impacts in planning for coastal resilience at the Cascadia subduction zone and globally.","Climate-driven sea-level rise is increasing the frequency of coastal flooding worldwide, exacerbated locally by factors like land subsidence from groundwater and resource extraction. However, a process rarely considered in future sea-level rise scenarios is sudden (over minutes) land subsidence associated with great (>M8) earthquakes, which can exceed 1 m. Along the Washington, Oregon, and northern California coasts, the next great Cascadia subduction zone earthquake could cause up to 2 m of sudden coastal subsidence, dramatically raising sea level, expanding floodplains, and increasing the flood risk to local communities. Here, we quantify the potential expansion of the 1% floodplain (i.e., the area with an annual flood risk of 1%) under low (~0.5 m), medium (~1 m), and high (~2 m) earthquake-driven subsidence scenarios at 24 Cascadia estuaries. If a great earthquake occurred today, floodplains could expand by 90 km2 (low), 160 km2 (medium), or 300 km2 (high subsidence), more than doubling the flooding exposure of residents, structures, and roads under the high subsidence scenario. By 2100, when climate-driven sea-level rise will compound the hazard, a great earthquake could expand floodplains by 170 km2 (low), 240 km2 (medium), or 370 km2 (high subsidence), more than tripling the flooding exposure of residents, structures, and roads under the high subsidence scenario compared to the 2023 floodplain. Our findings can support decision-makers and coastal communities along the Cascadia subduction zone as they prepare for compound hazards from the earthquake cycle and climate-driven sea-level rise and provide critical insights for tectonically active coastlines globally."
6,X and Y gene dosage effects are primary contributors to human sexual dimorphism: The case of height,Genetics,"Human stature is one of many physical phenotypes that vary between the sexes. On average, adult males are taller than females. However, the underlying biological mechanisms that explain this dimorphism are not entirely understood. Here, we compared heights in three large population-based cohorts that included 1,225 adults with sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). Having an extra Y chromosome conferred a larger increase in height than that observed with an additional X chromosome, independent of male hormonal effects. We conclude that differential expression of height-related pseudoautosomal genes on the X and Y chromosomes contributes to sexual dimorphism for stature. Beyond height, future SCA research may elucidate mechanisms underlying observed sex differences in the prevalence of autoimmune, neuropsychiatric, and other medical disorders.","Many human phenotypic traits vary between the sexes, including adult height for which males are, on average, 13 cm taller than females. The biological mechanisms for this sexual dimorphism are not entirely understood. One hypothesis to explain the sexual dimorphism in height relates to differential expression in males and females of SHOX, a height-related gene in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) on the X and Y sex chromosomes. SHOX expression is reduced on the inactive X chromosome (Xi), compared to the active X in females. Sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), characterized by an atypical number of X and/or Y chromosomes, serve as informative models for investigating PAR1-related gene dosage effects. Here, we leveraged three large biobanks to study 928,605 individuals, including 1,225 adults with SCAs: 45,X (n = 95), 47,XXY (n = 505), 47,XYY (n = 290), and 47,XXX (n = 335). By modeling height across individuals with various sex chromosome complements, we quantified the contributions of five sex-related genomic contributors to height, including Xi chromosome dosage, Y chromosome dosage, male sex hormones, and effects of Klinefelter and Turner syndromes. We found that a unit increase in Y chromosome dosage confers 3.1cm (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.3) more to height than a unit increase in Xi chromosome dosage, independent of hormonal variables. The larger increase in height conferred by the Y chromosome explained 22.6% of the observed difference in height between 46,XY males and 46,XX females. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that reduced SHOX expression in females results in a net difference in height between the sexes."
7,Neural network retuning and neural predictors of learning success associated with cello training,Neuroscience,"In sophisticated auditory–motor learning such as musical instrument learning, little is understood about how brain plasticity develops over time and how the related individual variability is reflected in the neural architecture. In a longitudinal fMRI training study on cello learning, we reveal the integrative function of the dorsal cortical stream in auditory–motor information processing, which comes online quickly during learning. Additionally, our data show that better performers optimize the recruitment of regions involved in auditory encoding and motor control and reveal the critical role of the pre-supplementary motor area and its interaction with auditory areas as predictors of musical proficiency. The present study provides unprecedented understanding of the neural substrates of individual learning variability and therefore has implications for pedagogy and rehabilitation.","The auditory and motor neural systems are closely intertwined, enabling people to carry out tasks such as playing a musical instrument whose mapping between action and sound is extremely sophisticated. While the dorsal auditory stream has been shown to mediate these audio–motor transformations, little is known about how such mapping emerges with training. Here, we use longitudinal training on a cello as a model for brain plasticity during the acquisition of specific complex skills, including continuous and many-to-one audio–motor mapping, and we investigate individual differences in learning. We trained participants with no musical background to play on a specially designed MRI-compatible cello and scanned them before and after 1 and 4 wk of training. Activation of the auditory-to-motor dorsal cortical stream emerged rapidly during the training and was similarly activated during passive listening and cello performance of trained melodies. This network activation was independent of performance accuracy and therefore appears to be a prerequisite of music playing. In contrast, greater recruitment of regions involved in auditory encoding and motor control over the training was related to better musical proficiency. Additionally, pre-supplementary motor area activity and its connectivity with the auditory cortex during passive listening before training was predictive of final training success, revealing the integrative function of this network in auditory–motor information processing. Together, these results clarify the critical role of the dorsal stream and its interaction with auditory areas in complex audio–motor learning."
8,Oxytocin-enforced norm compliance reduces xenophobic outgroup rejection,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"In the midst of rapid globalization, the peaceful coexistence of cultures requires a deeper understanding of the forces that compel prosocial behavior and thwart xenophobia. Yet, the conditions promoting such outgroup-directed altruism have not been determined. Here we report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment showing that enhanced activity of the oxytocin system paired with charitable social cues can help counter the effects of xenophobia by fostering altruism toward refugees. These findings suggest that the combination of oxytocin and peer-derived altruistic norms reduces outgroup rejection even in the most selfish and xenophobic individuals, and thereby would be expected to increase the ease by which people adapt to rapidly changing social ecosystems.","Never before have individuals had to adapt to social environments defined by such magnitudes of ethnic diversity and cultural differentiation. However, neurobiological evidence informing about strategies to reduce xenophobic sentiment and foster altruistic cooperation with outsiders is scarce. In a series of experiments settled in the context of the current refugee crisis, we tested the propensity of 183 Caucasian participants to make donations to people in need, half of whom were refugees (outgroup) and half of whom were natives (ingroup). Participants scoring low on xenophobic attitudes exhibited an altruistic preference for the outgroup, which further increased after nasal delivery of the neuropeptide oxytocin. In contrast, participants with higher levels of xenophobia generally failed to exhibit enhanced altruism toward the outgroup. This tendency was only countered by pairing oxytocin with peer-derived altruistic norms, resulting in a 74% increase in refugee-directed donations. Collectively, these findings reveal the underlying sociobiological conditions associated with outgroup-directed altruism by showing that charitable social cues co-occurring with enhanced activity of the oxytocin system reduce the effects of xenophobia by facilitating prosocial behavior toward refugees."
9,Behavioral interventions motivate action to address climate change,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Climate change poses an urgent threat to humans and ecosystems globally; human behavior is both cause and solution. Although a majority of people believe that climate change is occurring, many fail to take action. We conducted an intervention tournament, systematically testing 17 psychological strategies to motivate people to share information about climate change and take action in daily life. Our tournament offers insights into which strategies are most effective and why, identifying key mechanisms of action. Our findings are relevant to psychological theories of behavior change, motivation, decision making, learning, and information sharing. Crucially, our leading interventions could be readily scaled to develop accessible and engaging tools for climate change communication, of relevance to communicators, policymakers, and environmental scientists.","Mitigating climate change requires urgent action at individual, collective, and institutional levels. However, individuals may fail to act because they perceive climate change as a threat that is distant or not personally relevant, or believe their actions are not impactful. To address these psychological barriers, we conducted a large-scale “intervention tournament.” In a sample of 7,624 participants, we systematically tested 17 interventions that targeted psychological mechanisms described by three key themes: Relevance, Future Thinking, and Response Efficacy. Interventions that emphasized social relevance were the most effective for motivating people to share news articles and petitions about climate change. Interventions that targeted future thinking were the most effective for broadly motivating individual actions (e.g., driving less, eating vegetarian meals) and collective actions (e.g., donating, volunteering) to address climate change. Interventions that emphasized the environmental impact of these actions reliably increased the perceived impact of pro-environmental actions, but did not consistently motivate action. Notably, interventions that targeted two or more mechanisms—such as imagining a future scenario that involved oneself or close others—were most effective. Importantly, our leading interventions were substantially more effective than prevalent existing strategies (e.g., carbon footprint information). Our findings are relevant to theories of behavior change, motivation, and information sharing, with potential applications across domains. Insights from our tournament could be applied to develop scalable online interventions and mass communication campaigns to address climate change."
10,Flamingos use their L-shaped beak and morphing feet to induce vortical traps for prey capture,Ecology,"Flamingos employ their feet, L-shaped beak, and head movements to induce directional flow and recirculating eddies, effectively entrapping agile planktonic prey, such as brine shrimp, in muddy and hypersaline waters. This study reveals that flamingos, far from being passive filter-feeders, are active predators that use flow-induced traps to capture agile invertebrates.","Flamingos feature one of the most sophisticated filter-feeding systems among birds, characterized by upside-down feeding, comb-like lamellae, and a piston-like tongue. However, the hydrodynamic functions of their L-shaped chattering beak, S-curved neck, and distinct behaviors such as stomping and feeding against the flow remain a mystery. Combining live flamingo experiments with live brine shrimp and passive particles, bioinspired physical models, and 3D CFD simulations, we show that flamingos generate self-induced vortical traps using their heads, beaks, and feet to capture agile planktonic prey in harsh fluid environments. When retracting their heads rapidly (~40 cm/s), flamingos generate tornado-like vortices that stir up and upwell bottom sediments and live shrimp aided by their L-shaped beak. Remarkably, they also induce directional flows (~7 cm/s) through asymmetric beak chattering underwater (~12 Hz). Their morphing feet create horizontal eddies during stomping, lifting, and concentrating sediments and brine shrimp, while trapping fast-swimming invertebrates, as confirmed by using a 3D-printed morphing foot model. During interfacial skimming, flamingos produce a vortical recirculation zone at the beak’s tip, aiding in prey capture. Experiments using a flamingo-inspired particle collection system indicate that beak chattering improves capture rates by ~7×. These findings offer design principles for bioinspired particle collection systems that may be applied to remove pollutants and harmful microorganisms from water bodies."
11,Exotic mechanical properties enabled by countersnapping instabilities,Applied physical sciences ,"From an umbrella flipping inside out during a gust of wind to a slender stick bowing when compressed, mechanical instabilities are often seen as undesirable. However, they can also be leveraged, as illustrated by the snapping-based prey capture strategies of the Venus flytrap and mantis shrimp. Inspired by these observations, researchers have started to harness such nonlinear effects to design materials with exotic and programmable functions. Here, we expand this repertoire by experimentally demonstrating countersnapping, where a combination of geometrically nonlinear building blocks cooperate to suddenly contract when increasingly tensioned. We demonstrate that this behavior unlocks exotic mechanical and dynamical behavior, potentially useful for metamaterials, sensors, and smart structures.","Mechanical snapping instabilities are leveraged by natural systems, metamaterials, and devices for rapid sensing, actuation, and shape changes, as well as to absorb impact. In all current forms of snapping, shapes deform in the same direction as the exerted forces, even though there is no physical law that dictates this. Here, we realize countersnapping mechanical structures that respond in the opposite way. In contrast to regular snapping, countersnapping manifests itself in a sudden shortening transition under increasing tension or a sudden increase in tensile force under increasing extension. We design these structures by combining basic flexible building blocks that leverage geometric nonlinearities. We demonstrate experimentally that countersnapping can be employed to obtain new exotic properties, such as unidirectional stick–slip motion, switchable stiffness that does not otherwise affect the state of the system, and passive resonance avoidance. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining multiple countersnapping elements allows sequential stiffness switching for elements coupled in parallel, or instantaneous collective switching for elements in series. By expanding the repertoire of realizable elastic instabilities, our work opens routes to principles for mechanical sensing, computation, and actuation."
12,The echo chamber effect on social media,Computer sciences,"We explore the key differences between the main social media platforms and how they are likely to influence information spreading and the formation of echo chambers. To assess the different dynamics, we perform a comparative analysis on more than 100 million pieces of content concerning controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The analysis focuses on two main dimensions: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation in homophilic clusters of users dominates online dynamics. However, a direct comparison of news consumption on Facebook and Reddit shows higher segregation on Facebook.","Social media may limit the exposure to diverse perspectives and favor the formation of groups of like-minded users framing and reinforcing a shared narrative, that is, echo chambers. However, the interaction paradigms among users and feed algorithms greatly vary across social media platforms. This paper explores the key differences between the main social media platforms and how they are likely to influence information spreading and echo chambers’ formation. We perform a comparative analysis of more than 100 million pieces of content concerning several controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. We quantify echo chambers over social media by two main ingredients: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation of users in homophilic clusters dominate online interactions on Facebook and Twitter. We conclude the paper by directly comparing news consumption on Facebook and Reddit, finding higher segregation on Facebook."
13,The emergence of eukaryotes as an evolutionary algorithmic phase transition,Biophysics and computational biology,"For almost half the history of life on Earth, the complexity of all organisms was limited to that of simple prokaryotic cells such as contemporary bacteria. The process by which genes are activated, which is at the root of the functioning of all living beings, was entirely regulated by proteins. This set up a limit on cellular complexity, as finding even larger proteins became computationally unfeasible. The eukaryotic cell—characterized by membrane-bound nucleus and organelles—emerged as a compromise between a conserved process of gene growth and a change in genetic regulation, which incorporated noncoding sequences. This increase in cellular complexity, which occurred continuously but in an abrupt manner at a critical point, unlocked the path toward multicellular organisms.","The origin of eukaryotes represents one of the most significant events in evolution since it allowed the posterior emergence of multicellular organisms. Yet, it remains unclear how existing regulatory mechanisms of gene activity were transformed to allow this increase in complexity. Here, we address this question by analyzing the length distribution of proteins and their corresponding genes for 6,519 species across the tree of life. We find a scale-invariant relationship between gene mean length and variance maintained across the entire evolutionary history. Using a simple model, we show that this scale-invariant relationship naturally originates through a simple multiplicative process of gene growth. During the first phase of this process, corresponding to prokaryotes, protein length follows gene growth. At the onset of the eukaryotic cell, however, mean protein length stabilizes around 500 amino acids. While genes continued growing at the same rate as before, this growth primarily involved noncoding sequences that complemented proteins in regulating gene activity. Our analysis indicates that this shift at the origin of the eukaryotic cell was due to an algorithmic phase transition equivalent to that of certain search algorithms triggered by the constraints in finding increasingly larger proteins."
14,Framework to identify innovative sources of value creation from platform technologies,Medical sciences ,"Platform technologies are reshaping drug development by enabling cross-indication adaptability, rapid reuse of data, and faster clinical success. Yet no established framework comprehensively captures the full scope of their strategic and technical value. We address this gap by integrating systematic review, case analysis, and an assessment model to show how platform innovations drive near-term efficiency gains and long-term competitive advantages. Our findings highlight opportunities to quantify intangible value—such as organizational resilience and portfolio diversification—and set a benchmark for future comparative studies. To our knowledge, no existing approach unifies these elements; thus, our framework offers a distinct contribution for stakeholders seeking to optimize platform investments.","Platform technologies are fundamentally reshaping the pharmaceutical industry, offering unprecedented potential for innovation across multiple therapeutic areas. However, traditional valuation models, focused on single-asset metrics, struggle to capture the full spectrum of value these technologies create. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the innovative sources of value creation enabled by platform technologies throughout the drug development lifecycle. Through a systematic literature review, in-depth case studies, and framework development, we provide a structured methodology for capturing the diverse benefits of these technologies. Our findings reveal that platform technologies generate value across strategic, technical, and adaptive dimensions, requiring a multifaceted valuation approach. The proposed Platform Value Identification across Strategic, Technical, and Adaptive domains Framework defines key value drivers, specifies quantitative assessment metrics, and provides implementation guidance to inform strategic decision-making in research and development investment, portfolio management, and business development. Application of the framework to case studies of Alnylam’s RNAi platform, Genentech’s therapeutic antibody platform, and Moderna’s mRNA platform demonstrates its broad utility and impact potential. By adopting this holistic, data-driven approach, stakeholders can better assess the long-term value and competitive advantages of well-implemented platform technologies, accelerating the development of transformative therapies for patients."
15,Tool use aids prey-fishing in a specialist predator of stingless bees,Evolution,"Tool use is a well-established behavior where external objects are manipulated by the tool user to modify the physical properties of another object for benefit. However, the functional mechanisms behind such behaviors remain underexplored. Here, we demonstrate that a stingless bee-specialist assassin bug employs its prey’s defensive resin as a hunting tool. By manipulating the resin, the predator amplifies chemical cues that stimulate colony defense, facilitating hunting by luring attacking bees to the predator’s optimal hunting position. This finding provides comprehensive empirical evidence of tool use in an invertebrate predator interacting with its social prey. Our findings offer insights into the adaptive function and mechanisms of tool use and highlight the role of dietary specialization in shaping such behaviors.","Tool use is widely reported across a broad range of the animal kingdom, yet comprehensive empirical tests of its function and evolutionary drivers remain scarce, predominantly focused on a few relatively intelligent vertebrate lineages. In this study, we provide a comprehensive examination of tool use behavior in the assassin bug Pahabengkakia piliceps, a specialist predator of stingless bees that exploits resin droplet from bee nest entrance to facilitate hunting. Field behavioral experiments demonstrated that resin use is critical for hunting success, as the predator uses resin to stimulate the colonial defense of stingless bees, luring attacking bees toward its optimal hunting position. Chemical analysis revealed that resin processing by the assassin bug enhances the emission of volatile compounds, making the resin more attractive and stimulating to guard bees. Through these experiments, we empirically demonstrate how an invertebrate predator adapts to the colony defense of social insects via tool use behavior. We further propose that complex tool use can evolve under selective pressures driven by diet specialization. Our findings offer a new model for studying the adaptive functions and underlying mechanisms of tool use behaviors in animals."
16,Global patterns of nutrient limitation in soil microorganisms,Ecology ,"Limitation of soil microorganisms by key nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) controls ecosystem processes, including soil carbon cycling. Thus, it is fundamental to understand patterns of microbial nutrient limitation. However, in contrast to plant nutrient limitation, global patterns of nutrient limitation in soil microorganisms are unclear. Our global investigation found that P limitation was more widespread than N limitation but also that N and P colimitation was pervasive in tropical regions. These findings are important because they help to identify areas where soil functions (e.g., organic matter decomposition) may be vulnerable to nutrient perturbations and can help improve predictions of soil biogeochemical cycles under global change.","The availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is essential for soil microbial activity and growth, yet global patterns of N and P limitation in soil microbial metabolism remain largely unknown. We modeled ecoenzyme stoichiometry data from 5,259 field observations of natural ecosystems to assess microbial N and P limitation in global surface soils. We found that microbial P limitation, which was especially strong at low latitudes, was more prevalent globally than microbial N limitation, which prevailed in cold environments. We also found widespread N and P colimitation in soil microorganisms in the tropics, contradicting the long-held paradigm that P, and not N, is the primary limiting nutrient at low latitudes. This colimitation could be attributable to elevated microbial N demand for the synthesis of P-acquiring enzymes under P limitation. Upscaling (0.1 × 0.1° spatial resolution) suggested that soil microorganisms were limited by N and P in 39% and 57%, respectively, of natural terrestrial surface areas, with 21% of areas with N and P colimitation. As a global assessment of spatial variation in microbial N and P limitation, our results highlight the importance of N availability in supporting microbial P acquisition at low latitudes and improve our understanding of microbial nutrient limitation on a global scale."
17,Time-lagged recurrence: A data-driven method to estimate the predictability of dynamical systems,Applied mathematics,"In many complex systems, predictability can be substantially state-dependent. We propose here a purely data-driven approach for estimating the local predictability at different time scales. The effectiveness of our approach is validated against existing knowledge, and its relationship to commonly used metrics in the dynamical systems literature is discussed. Our approach provides useful and convincing insights for both simple and real-world systems, including large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns in the Euro-Atlantic sector, clarifying key aspects of their predictability. Additionally, it can be used as a diagnostic tool in existing data-driven workflows to better understand the behavior of dynamical systems, opening a wide range of research opportunities.","Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive its faithful representation. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. When applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets arising from large-scale atmospheric fields, our approach proves its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with other local dynamical indices, and how it reveals the scale-dependent nature of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its link to information theory, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems."
18,TCP3 is a substrate of the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase to regulate anthocyanin accumulation and flowering time in Arabidopsis,Plant biology,"Light is an important environmental cue that enables plants to adapt to the ambient light conditions. A key component of the light signaling network is the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase which causes degradation of multiple transcription factors. These transcription factors share a Valine-Proline (VP) motif responsible for binding COP1/SPA. Here, we have identified a degradation substrate (TCP3) that is recognized by COP1/SPA in a noncanonical, VP-independent fashion. We demonstrate that COP1/SPA promotes TCP3 degradation in darkness and preferentially under short day. This process inhibits the biosynthesis of anthocyanin and delays flowering. Our findings not only expand the substrate selection mode of COP1/SPA, but also uncovered a transcription factor family involved in the complex COP1/SPA-dependent signaling network.","COP1 is a conserved ubiquitin ligase found in plants and animals. In plants, COP1 acts together with SPA proteins to suppress light signaling in darkness by promoting the degradation of transcription factors involved in photomorphogenesis. Substrates of this ubiquitin ligase share a Valine-Proline (VP) motif that interacts with the WD-repeat domain of COP1 in plants and humans. Here, we have identified the transcription factor TCP3 as a noncanonical substrate of COP1/SPA that lacks a VP motif. The TCP domain of TCP3 directly interacts with the WD-repeat domains of COP1 and SPA1. TCP3 requires the VP-binding cleft of COP1 for protein–protein interaction. We further show that the TCP3 protein is degraded in darkness and preferentially in short day through a COP1-dependent manner, while TCP3 is stabilized by red, far-red, blue light, and long day conditions. COP1/SPA-mediated degradation of TCP3 inhibits anthocyanin accumulation by reducing the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. COP1/SPA-mediated degradation of TCP3 is also important in regulating flowering time. Taken together, our results have identified a noncanonical substrate of the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase, thereby also uncovering TCPs as a transcription factor family that is targeted by COP1/SPA. Since the COP1/SPA-interacting TCP domain is conserved among TCPs, it is possible that other members of the TCP family—having divergent functions including cell fate determination and hormone signaling—are targets of COP1/SPA as well."
19,Measuring actual learning versus feeling of learning in response to being actively engaged in the classroom,Applied physical sciences ,"Despite active learning being recognized as a superior method of instruction in the classroom, a major recent survey found that most college STEM instructors still choose traditional teaching methods. This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.","We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom."
20,The impact of COVID-19 on small business outcomes and expectations,Economic sciences,"Drawing on a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses, this paper provides insight into the economic impact of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on small businesses. The results shed light on both the financial fragility of many small businesses, and the significant impact COVID-19 had on these businesses in the weeks after the COVID-19–related disruptions began. The results also provide evidence on businesses’ expectations about the longer-term impact of COVID-19, as well as their perceptions of relief programs offered by the government.","To explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on small businesses, we conducted a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses between March 28 and April 4, 2020. Several themes emerged. First, mass layoffs and closures had already occurred—just a few weeks into the crisis. Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than $10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the program, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility. Using experimental variation, we also assess take-up rates and business resilience effects for loans relative to grants-based programs."
21,Cross-feeding creates tipping points in microbiome diversity,Applied physical sciences,"Understanding how diversity is maintained in microbial communities presents a significant challenge, as cross-feeding networks create complex interdependencies between consumer populations that can be hard to disentangle. We address this problem by using methods from network percolation theory to develop a model that captures the dependence of microbial community diversity on cross-feeding network structure. Our results identify tipping points at which small structural changes can trigger the collapse of cross-feeding networks, leading to catastrophic loss of diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how perturbations to cross-feeding networks affect diversity, showing how the difficulty of culturing diverse microbiomes may arise from the structural constraints of their interaction networks. These findings offer insights into the fundamental mechanisms shaping microbiomes and their robustness.","A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the interactions among their many functionally distinct populations. This process is driven in part by the cross-feeding networks that help to structure these systems, in which consumers use resources to fuel their metabolism, creating by-products which can be used by others in the community. Understanding the effects of cross-feeding presents a major challenge, as it creates complex interdependencies between populations which can be hard to untangle. We address this problem using the tools of network science to develop a structural microbial community model. Using methods from percolation theory, we identify feasible community states for cross-feeding network structures in which the needs of consumers are met by metabolite production across the community. We identify tipping points at which small changes in structure can cause the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks and abrupt declines in microbial community diversity. Our results are an example of a well-defined tipping point in a complex ecological system and provide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiomes and their robustness. We further demonstrate this by considering how network attacks affect community diversity and apply our results to show how the apparent difficulty in culturing the microbial diversity emerges as an inherent property of their cross-feeding networks."
22,The GRAS protein RAM1 interacts with WRI transcription factors to regulate plant genes required for arbuscule development and function,Plant biology,"Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis is formed by soil-inhabiting Glomeromycotina fungi and most land plants and can significantly promote plant performance via enhanced nutrient uptake. The fungi form branched hyphal structures, the arbuscules, within root cortex cells that provide the major interface for nutrient exchange. Coordination of arbuscule formation and reciprocal nutrient exchange require complex transcriptional changes in colonized cells. The protein REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 1 (RAM1) is important for transcriptional regulation in arbuscule-containing cells but predicted not to bind DNA. We demonstrate that RAM1 interacts with five DNA-binding AM-induced WRI transcription factors to activate plant genes involved in nutrient exchange, arbuscule formation, and maintenance. This provides important mechanistic insights into the regulation of an ecologically important plant-fungal symbiosis.","During arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis AM fungi form tree-shaped structures called arbuscules in root cortex cells of host plants. Arbuscules and their host cells are central for reciprocal nutrient exchange between the symbionts. REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION1 (RAM1) encodes a GRAS protein crucial for transcriptionally regulating plant genes needed for arbuscule development and nutrient exchange. Similar to other GRAS proteins, RAM1 likely does not bind to DNA and how RAM1 activates its target promoters remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RAM1 interacts with five AM-induced APETALA 2 (AP2) transcription factors of the WRINKLED1-like family called CTTC MOTIF-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (CBX1), WRI3, WRI5a, WRI5b, and WRI5c via a C-terminal domain containing the M2/M2a motif. This motif is conserved and enriched in WRI proteins encoded by genomes of AM-competent plants. RAM1 together with any of these WRI proteins activates the promoters of genes required for symbiotic nutrient exchange, namely RAM2, STUNTED ARBUSCULES (STR), and PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 4 (PT4), in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This activation as well as target promoter induction in Lotus japonicus hairy roots depends on MYCS (MYCORRHIZA SEQUENCE)-elements and AW-boxes, previously identified as WRI-binding sites. The WRI genes are activated in two waves: Transcription of RAM1, CBX1, and WRI3 is coregulated by calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-activated CYCLOPS, through the AMCYC-RE in their promoter, and DELLA, while WRI5a, b, and c promoters contain MYCS-elements and AW-boxes and can be activated by RAM1 heterocomplexes with CBX1 or WRI3. We propose that RAM1 provides an activation domain to DNA-binding WRI proteins to activate genes with central roles in AM development and function."
23,Risk-aware electricity dispatch with large-scale distributed renewable integration under climate extremes,Engineering,"Electric power system infrastructure faces significant challenges under climate extremes such as hurricanes, particularly in distribution networks involving large-scale distributed renewable systems. Current electricity dispatch approaches focus on the transmission network, not accurately accounting for distribution-level risks that threaten power balance. We present a risk-aware optimization model integrating these risks into electricity dispatch with cost-effective, flexible solutions. Using the test system of the 2022 Puerto Rico power grid under Hurricane Fiona, this model reduces reliance on additional flexibility resources and achieves significant cost savings compared to conventional methods. Sensitivity analysis of various distributed renewable integration levels consistently demonstrates its superiority, highlighting a practical solution for operating future net-zero power systems under intensifying climate risks.","Distribution networks, with large-scale integration of distributed renewable resources, particularly rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, represent the most extensive yet vulnerable components of modern electric power systems during climate extremes such as hurricanes. However, existing day-ahead electricity dispatch approaches primarily focus on the transmission network and lack the capability to manage the spatiotemporal risks associated with the vast distribution networks, which can potentially lead to significant power imbalances due to the mismatches between scheduled generation and actual demand. To address this increasingly critical gap under intensifying climate extremes and growing distributed renewable integration, we introduce Risk-aware Electricity Dispatch under Climate Extremes with Renewable integration (REDUCER), a risk-aware day-ahead electricity dispatch model that incorporates high-resolution spatiotemporal risk analysis for distribution networks with large-scale distributed renewable integration into an Entropic Value-at-Risk-constrained mixed-integer convex optimization framework. Applied to the 2022 Puerto Rico power grid under Hurricane Fiona, the proposed REDUCER model is seen to effectively manage these risks with substantially less reliance on additional flexibility resources to cope with power imbalances, reducing overall operational costs by about 30% under extreme cases compared to standard unit commitment strategies already informed by average demand loss. Also, the proposed REDUCER model consistently demonstrates its effectiveness in managing the increasing temporal net demand variability introduced by growing large-scale distributed solar integration while maintaining minimal operational costs. This model offers a practical solution for cost-effective and resilient electricity dispatch of modern power systems with large-scale renewable integration facing intensifying climate risks."
24,Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems,Applied mathematics,"Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.","Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing."
25,A complete and dynamic tree of birds,Evolution,"Birds are charismatic—well loved, and highly studied. Many new phylogenies elucidating avian evolutionary relationships are published every year. We have united phylogenetic estimates from hundreds of studies to create a complete evolutionary tree of all birds. While a variety of resources aggregate huge collections of trait, behavior, and location data for birds, previously the barriers to linking data between these data resources and bird evolutionary history have limited the opportunities to do exciting large-scale analyses. We have bridged that gap and developed a system that allows us to easily update our understanding of bird evolution as new estimates are generated. We share a workflow and the software needed to create a complete evolutionary tree for any group.","We present a complete, time-scaled, evolutionary tree of the world’s bird species. This tree unites phylogenetic estimates for 9,239 species from 262 studies published between 1990 and 2024, using the Open Tree synthesis algorithm. The remaining species are placed in the tree based on curated taxonomic information. The tips of this complete tree are aligned to the species in the Clements Taxonomy used by eBird and other resources, and cross-mapped to other taxonomic systems including the Open Tree of Life (Open Tree), National Center for Biotechnology Information, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The total number of named bird species varies between 10,824 and 11,017 across the taxonomy versions we applied (v2021, v2022, and v2023). We share complete trees for each taxonomy version. The procedure, software, and data stores we used to generate this tree are public and reproducible. The tree presented here is Aves 1.3 and can be easily updated with new phylogenetic information as new estimates are published. We demonstrate the types of large-scale analyses this data resource enables by linking geographic data with the phylogeny to calculate the regional phylogenetic diversity of birds across the world. We will release updated versions of the phylogenetic synthesis and taxonomic translation tables annually. The procedure we describe here can be applied to developing complete phylogenetic estimates for any taxonomic group of interest."
26,Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging,Neuroscience ,"Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the prototypical “psychedelic,” may be unique among psychoactive substances. In the decades that followed its discovery, the magnitude of its effect on science, the arts, and society was unprecedented. LSD produces profound, sometimes life-changing experiences in microgram doses, making it a particularly powerful scientific tool. Here we sought to examine its effects on brain activity, using cutting-edge and complementary neuroimaging techniques in the first modern neuroimaging study of LSD. Results revealed marked changes in brain blood flow, electrical activity, and network communication patterns that correlated strongly with the drug’s hallucinatory and other consciousness-altering properties. These results have implications for the neurobiology of consciousness and for potential applications of LSD in psychological research.","Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD’s marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug’s other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of “ego-dissolution” and “altered meaning,” implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of “self” or “ego” and its processing of “meaning.” Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others."
27,Coupling between electrons’ spin and proton transfer in chiral biological crystals,Applied physical sciences,"This research uncovers a groundbreaking link between electron spin and proton transport in biological environment, using lysozyme as a model system. Proton transfer, vital in many life processes, is shown to couple with electron spin polarization, a discovery aligned with the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect. Specifically, we show that proton conduction through the lysozyme crystal is selective to the polarization of injected electrons, highlighting a synergy between spin polarization and information transfer in life. This mechanism provides insights into proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes, emphasizing the role of chirality in biological processes. These findings bridge quantum physics with biochemistry enabling better understanding and opening the possibility of controlled information transfer in biological environments.","Proton transport plays a fundamental role in many biological and chemical systems. In life, proton transport is crucial for biochemical and physiological functions. It is usually accepted that the main mechanism of proton transfer is a result of hopping between neighboring water molecules and amino acid side chains. It was recently suggested that the proton transfer can be simultaneously coupled with electron transfer. As life is homochiral, proton transfer in biology is occurring in a chiral environment. In this environment, the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect relating to electron transfer and chirality is expected to occur. The present work establishes that the proton transfer is coupled to a specific electron spin polarization in lysozyme crystals, associating proton transfer to electron movement and polarization. To preserve total angular momentum, this motion may be coupled to chiral phonons that propagate in the crystal. Our work shows that the interaction of the electrons’ spin and phonons is very significant in proton transfer through lysosome crystals. Injecting the opposite electron spin into the lysosome crystal results in a significant change in proton transfer impedance. This study presents the support for the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism and indicates the importance of spin polarization in the process."
28,A combined experimental and computational analysis of mantATP turnover in skinned muscle fibers,Biophysics and computational biology,"Myosin resting states play a critical role in regulating muscle contractility and basal metabolism. The mantATP chasing technique has been widely used to assess the nucleotide turnover of resting myosin associated with the Super Relaxed State (SRX). However, recent studies have raised questions about the reliability of results obtained using this technique across various models. Given the growing interest in understanding myosin resting energy consumption, we focused on skinned fibers to better characterize the limitations of this method and to develop a more reliable analytical approach for estimating SRX. Accurate interpretation of myosin resting states is essential for a range of research fields, from drug development to clinical evaluation, where insights into muscle function and energy dynamics are critical.","Myosin is the primary motor protein in skeletal muscle, responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis that drives muscle contraction. In addition to force production, resting myosin consumes ATP in futile cycles at two rates, the slower one being associated with the Super Relaxed State (SRX), in contrast to the less inhibited Disordered Relaxed State (DRX). The SRX is typically measured using the mantATP chasing technique, where the decay of a fluorescent ATP analogue is fitted using a multiexponential function. Recently, significant concerns have been raised regarding the use of this technique, particularly when applied to soluble myosin preparations. While skinned fibers offer the advantage of preserving the native thick filament structure and myosin cooperativity, limited diffusion and nonspecific mantATP binding pose challenges. In this study, we combine experimental data and in-silico modeling to dissect the contributions of different components in the mantATP chasing signal. We analyze control skinned fibers and fibers subjected to myosin extraction. Our analysis shows that the nonspecific component partially overlaps with the DRX timescale. In contrast, the slow component linked to myosin SRX nucleotide release is characterized by a time constant that significantly differs from those of the nonspecific signal and DRX, enabling its reliable estimation using this technique. Our findings indicate that evaluating nonspecific mantATP components is necessary to obtain a reliable estimation of both SRX and DRX. We validated our analysis by comparing populations and time constants obtained from chasing with mantATP to mantATPase rates in control conditions and upon piperine-induced SRX destabilization."
29,Acoustic percolation switches enable targeted drug delivery controlled by diagnostic ultrasound,Agricultural sciences,"The concept of remote-controlled devices that can enter the body and deliver biomedicines to specific sites of disease is a long-held vision in biomedical research. However, most existing devices for externally triggered delivery are based on complex micromachines that are controlled with electromagnetic waves and require custom external instrumentation. Here, we present a much simpler drug delivery platform comprising hydrogels that contain unique air-filled proteins allowing the gel to be both imaged and triggered to release drugs at specific locations using widely available ultrasound imaging devices. We validate this technology by delivering anti-inflammatory antibodies to effectively treat a rat model of colitis. Targeted acoustic percolation switches (TAPS) have the potential to bring image-guided drug delivery closer to everyday clinical practice.","Delivering biomedicines to specific sites of disease using remote-controlled devices is a long-standing vision in biomedical research. However, most existing externally triggered delivery systems are based on complex micromachines that are controlled with electromagnetic waves and require custom external instrumentation. Here, we present a drug delivery platform based on a simple protein-containing hydrogel that can be both imaged and triggered to release drugs at specific locations using widely available diagnostic ultrasound devices. This technology is based on the addition of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs) to hydrogel delivery vehicles. While intact, GVs sterically block the release of drug payloads and allow the vehicle to be imaged with ultrasound. An increase in ultrasound pressure causes the collapse of GVs within the delivery vehicles at the desired anatomical location, instantly creating percolation channels in the hydrogel, massively increasing diffusivity, and leading to rapid drug release. Unlike previous ultrasound-actuated delivery approaches, both the imaging and release are performed using a simple diagnostic ultrasound probe ubiquitously available in clinical settings. We implement this concept by quantifying ultrasound-controlled drug diffusion and release in vitro and demonstrating image-guided protein delivery in vivo in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract following oral administration. We further validate this technology by using it to deliver anti-inflammatory antibodies to effectively treat a rat model of colitis. Targeted acoustic percolation switches (TAPS) open a conduit for local, image-guided drug delivery with a simple formulation and commonplace ultrasound equipment."
30,"Racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations, and false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites",Psychological and cognitive sciences,"The present work examines beliefs associated with racial bias in pain management, a critical health care domain with well-documented racial disparities. Specifically, this work reveals that a substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites and demonstrates that these beliefs predict racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation accuracy. It also provides the first evidence that racial bias in pain perception is associated with racial bias in pain treatment recommendations. Taken together, this work provides evidence that false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black people—they are associated with racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations.","Black Americans are systematically undertreated for pain relative to white Americans. We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., “black people’s skin is thicker than white people’s skin”). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient’s pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient’s pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment."
31,Rapid single-particle chemical imaging of nanoplastics by SRS microscopy,Chemistry,"Micro-nano plastics originating from the prevalent usage of plastics have raised increasingly alarming concerns worldwide. However, there remains a fundamental knowledge gap in nanoplastics because of the lack of effective analytical techniques. This study developed a powerful optical imaging technique for rapid analysis of nanoplastics with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. As a demonstration, micro-nano plastics in bottled water are analyzed with multidimensional profiling of individual plastic particles. Quantification suggests more than 105 particles in each liter of bottled water, the majority of which are nanoplastics. This study holds the promise to bridge the knowledge gap on plastic pollution at the nano level.","Plastics are now omnipresent in our daily lives. The existence of microplastics (1 µm to 5 mm in length) and possibly even nanoplastics (<1 μm) has recently raised health concerns. In particular, nanoplastics are believed to be more toxic since their smaller size renders them much more amenable, compared to microplastics, to enter the human body. However, detecting nanoplastics imposes tremendous analytical challenges on both the nano-level sensitivity and the plastic-identifying specificity, leading to a knowledge gap in this mysterious nanoworld surrounding us. To address these challenges, we developed a hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging platform with an automated plastic identification algorithm that allows micro-nano plastic analysis at the single-particle level with high chemical specificity and throughput. We first validated the sensitivity enhancement of the narrow band of SRS to enable high-speed single nanoplastic detection below 100 nm. We then devised a data-driven spectral matching algorithm to address spectral identification challenges imposed by sensitive narrow-band hyperspectral imaging and achieve robust determination of common plastic polymers. With the established technique, we studied the micro-nano plastics from bottled water as a model system. We successfully detected and identified nanoplastics from major plastic types. Micro-nano plastics concentrations were estimated to be about 2.4 ± 1.3 × 105 particles per liter of bottled water, about 90% of which are nanoplastics. This is orders of magnitude more than the microplastic abundance reported previously in bottled water. High-throughput single-particle counting revealed extraordinary particle heterogeneity and nonorthogonality between plastic composition and morphologies; the resulting multidimensional profiling sheds light on the science of nanoplastics."
32,Mitochondria regulate MR1 protein expression and produce self-metabolites that activate MR1-restricted T cells,Immunology and inflammation,"Recent reports indicate that T cells can recognize self-metabolites that accumulate in tumor cells and are presented by MHC-related protein 1 (MR1). This study identifies mitochondria as a source of MR1-presented antigens, which are key for promoting MR1 protein expression, generating immunogenic metabolites presented by MR1, and stimulating T cells. The mitochondrial activities involved include complex III, oxidative phosphorylation, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase enzyme, and de novo pyrimidine synthesis. A nucleobase antigen was identified, specific T cells were isolated, and the MR1-Ag structure was resolved. Therefore, the immunological role of mitochondria extends beyond energy production, highlighting the connection between nucleobase metabolism and immune recognition. This study suggests that tumor cells with unique metabolic alterations are targets for MR1-self-metabolite-specific T cells.","Mitochondria coordinate several metabolic pathways, producing metabolites that influence the immune response in various ways. It remains unclear whether mitochondria impact antigen presentation by the MHC-class-I-related antigen-presenting molecule, MR1, which presents small molecules to MR1-restricted T-lymphocytes. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial complex III and the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are essential for the cell-surface expression of MR1 and for generating uridine- and thymidine-related compounds that bind to MR1 and are produced upon oxidation by reactive oxygen species. One mitochondria-derived immunogenic formylated metabolite we identified is 5-formyl-deoxyuridine (5-FdU). Structural studies indicate that 5-FdU binds in the A’-antigen-binding pocket of MR1, positioning the deoxyribose toward the surface of MR1 for TCR interaction. 5-FdU stimulates specific T cells and detects circulating T cells when loaded onto MR1-tetramers. 5-FdU-reactive cells resemble adaptive T cells and express the phenotypes of naïve, memory, and effector cells, indicating prior in vivo stimulation. These findings suggest that mitochondria may play a role in MR1-mediated immune surveillance."
33,Income and emotional well-being: A conflict resolved,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Measures of well-being have often been found to rise with log (income). Kahneman and Deaton [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 16489–93 (2010)] reported an exception; a measure of emotional well-being (happiness) increased but then flattened somewhere between $60,000 and $90,000. In contrast, Killingsworth [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2016976118 (2021)] observed a linear relation between happiness and log(income) in an experience-sampling study. We discovered in a joint reanalysis of the experience sampling data that the flattening pattern exists but is restricted to the least happy 20% of the population, and that complementary nonlinearities contribute to the overall linear-log relationship between happiness and income. We trace the discrepant results to the authors’ reliance on standard practices and assumptions of data analysis that should be questioned more often, although they are standard in social science.","Do larger incomes make people happier? Two authors of the present paper have published contradictory answers. Using dichotomous questions about the preceding day, [Kahneman and Deaton, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 16489–16493 (2010)] reported a flattening pattern: happiness increased steadily with log(income) up to a threshold and then plateaued. Using experience sampling with a continuous scale, [Killingsworth, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2016976118 (2021)] reported a linear-log pattern in which average happiness rose consistently with log(income). We engaged in an adversarial collaboration to search for a coherent interpretation of both studies. A reanalysis of Killingsworth’s experienced sampling data confirmed the flattening pattern only for the least happy people. Happiness increases steadily with log(income) among happier people, and even accelerates in the happiest group. Complementary nonlinearities contribute to the overall linear-log relationship. We then explain why Kahneman and Deaton overstated the flattening pattern and why Killingsworth failed to find it. We suggest that Kahneman and Deaton might have reached the correct conclusion if they had described their results in terms of unhappiness rather than happiness; their measures could not discriminate among degrees of happiness because of a ceiling effect. The authors of both studies failed to anticipate that increased income is associated with systematic changes in the shape of the happiness distribution. The mislabeling of the dependent variable and the incorrect assumption of homogeneity were consequences of practices that are standard in social science but should be questioned more often. We flag the benefits of adversarial collaboration."
34,ICT usage increases workforce geographical diversity,Environmental sciences,"This study establishes a causal link between information and communication technology (ICT) usage and workforce geographical diversity, offering insights into how technology shapes labor mobility and connectivity across geographic spaces. By addressing critical challenges in inclusivity, equity, and sustainability, the research highlights the transformative role of ICT in enhancing labor mobility and urban integration. The findings provide actionable guidance for policymakers to foster digitally inclusive cities, balancing workforce diversity with regional disparities and sustainability concerns. As cities worldwide confront the pressures of equity and sustainability, this study presents a framework for leveraging digital technology to create productive and sustainable urban futures.","The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) by rural–urban migrants is reshaping job-search mobility, significantly shaping city-level workforce geographical diversity. This study provides compelling evidence of ICT’s impact by examining China’s cities. We introduce the rural–urban migrant workforce Geographical Diversity Index (GDI), a metric that captures the mobility patterns of 20 million migrant workers across Chinese cities from Q1 2019 to Q4 2023. This study highlights how ICT usage shapes migration dynamics and connectivity across geographic spaces, with implications for labor mobility and urban inclusivity. Using panel vector autoregression models, we establish a causal relationship between ICT usage and GDI, revealing heterogeneous impacts: large cities and male workers benefit more from ICT usage than small cities and female workers. While ICT-driven diversity enhances labor productivity, it also increases migrant workers’ job-hunting travel distances, contributing to higher carbon emissions. These findings underscore the dual role of ICT as a facilitator of inclusivity and a source of sustainability challenges, offering critical insights for policymakers aiming to leverage digital tools for equitable and sustainable urban development."
35,Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences,Biophysics and computational biology,"Learning biological properties from sequence data is a logical step toward generative and predictive artificial intelligence for biology. Here, we propose scaling a deep contextual language model with unsupervised learning to sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. We find that without prior knowledge, information emerges in the learned representations on fundamental properties of proteins such as secondary structure, contacts, and biological activity. We show the learned representations are useful across benchmarks for remote homology detection, prediction of secondary structure, long-range residue–residue contacts, and mutational effect. Unsupervised representation learning enables state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improves state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.","In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction."
36,"Brain aging shows nonlinear transitions, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for metabolic intervention",Neuroscience,"Age-related cognitive decline is associated with metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory changes, making it challenging to distinguish primary causes from secondary (downstream) effects. This study demonstrates that brain aging follows a specific progression, with the first stage occurring in middle age and coinciding with increased insulin resistance. Moreover, we show that brain areas that age fastest are also those most vulnerable to neuronal insulin resistance. Importantly, we find that administering ketones, which can fuel neurons while bypassing insulin resistance, reverses brain aging effects. However, this intervention is only effective when provided early enough for neurons to remain viable. These findings contribute to our understanding of brain aging mechanisms and suggest neurometabolic strategies for targeted early intervention in preventing age-related cognitive decline.","Understanding the key drivers of brain aging is essential for effective prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we integrate human brain and physiological data to investigate underlying mechanisms. Functional MRI analyses across four large datasets (totaling 19,300 participants) show that brain networks not only destabilize throughout the lifetime but do so along a nonlinear trajectory, with consistent temporal “landmarks” of brain aging starting in midlife (40s). Comparison of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers implicate dysregulated glucose homeostasis as the driver mechanism for these transitions. Correlation between the brain’s regionally heterogeneous patterns of aging and gene expression further supports these findings, selectively implicating GLUT4 (insulin-dependent glucose transporter) and APOE (lipid transport protein). Notably, MCT2 (a neuronal, but not glial, ketone transporter) emerges as a potential counteracting factor by facilitating neurons’ energy uptake independently of insulin. Consistent with these results, an interventional study of 101 participants shows that ketones exhibit robust effects in restabilizing brain networks, maximized from ages 40 to 60, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for early metabolic intervention."
37,Discovery of an LSD1 PROTAC degrader,Applied biological sciences,"The scaffolding role of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), beyond its catalytic function, is critical in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression. Here, we report the development of MS9117, a potent PROTAC degrader that effectively induces LSD1 degradation. Compared to current inhibitors, MS9117 more strongly suppresses AML cell proliferation and promotes differentiation. Therefore, MS9117 represents a powerful chemical tool compound to study broader roles of LSD1 in AML and a potential therapeutic, especially when combined with all-trans retinoic acid for potential clinical applications in nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML.","Aberrant expression of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has been implicated in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent studies have revealed both catalytic and noncatalytic oncogenic functions of LSD1, which cannot be effectively addressed by traditional small-molecule inhibitors. Therefore, to remove LSD1 and mitigate its oncogenic activity, we utilized the proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) approach and developed an LSD1 PROTAC degrader MS9117, which recruits the E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN). MS9117 induces LSD1 degradation in a concentration-, time-, CRBN-, and proteasome-dependent manner. Importantly, MS9117 effectively degrades LSD1 and demonstrates superior antiproliferative effects in AML cells, compared to the existing pharmacological LSD1 inhibitors. Furthermore, MS9117 also sensitized nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML cells to all-trans retinoic acid treatment. Moreover, we developed two negative controls of MS9117, MS9117N1 and MS9117N2, which do not degrade LSD1 or inhibit leukemia cell growth, further confirming the mechanism of action of MS9117. Overall, MS9117 serves as a valuable chemical tool and a potential therapeutic to target both the catalytic and scaffolding functions of LSD1. With several LSD1 inhibitors already in clinical development, the LSD1 degraders such as MS9117 offer an additional option for future clinical studies."
38,Physician–patient racial concordance and newborn mortality,Demography,"An influential study suggests that Black newborns experience much lower mortality when attended by Black physicians after birth. Using the same data, we replicate those findings and estimate alternative models that include controls for very low birth weights, a key determinant of neonatal mortality not included in the original analysis. The estimated racial concordance effect is substantially weakened, and often becomes statistically insignificant, after controlling for the impact of very low birth weights on mortality. Our results raise questions about the role played by physician–patient racial matching in determining Black neonatal mortality and suggest that the key to narrowing the Black–White gap may continue to lie in reducing the incidence of such low birth weights among Black newborns.","The racial gap in infant mortality is a pressing public-health concern, and [B. N. Greenwood et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117, 21194–21200 (2020), https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913405117] suggest that Black newborns are more likely to survive if cared for by Black physicians after birth, even in models that control for numerous variables, including hospital and physician fixed effects, and the 65 most common comorbidities affecting newborns (as described by International Classification of Disease codes). We acquired the data used in the study, covering Florida hospital discharges from 1992 through the third quarter of 2015, to replicate and extend the analysis. We find that the magnitude of the concordance effect is substantially reduced after controlling for diagnoses indicating very low birth weight (<1,500 g), which are a strong predictor of neonatal mortality but not among the 65 most common comorbidities. In fact, the estimated effect is near zero and statistically insignificant in the expanded specifications that control for very low birth weight and include hospital and physician fixed effects."
39,The effectiveness of nudging: A meta-analysis of choice architecture interventions across behavioral domains,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Changing individuals’ behavior is key to tackling some of today’s most pressing societal challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic or climate change. Choice architecture interventions aim to nudge people toward personally and socially desirable behavior through the design of choice environments. Although increasingly popular, little is known about the overall effectiveness of choice architecture interventions and the conditions under which they facilitate behavior change. Here we quantitatively review over a decade of research, showing that choice architecture interventions successfully promote behavior change across key behavioral domains, populations, and locations. Our findings offer insights into the effects of choice architecture and provide guidelines for behaviorally informed policy making.","Over the past decade, choice architecture interventions or so-called nudges have received widespread attention from both researchers and policy makers. Built on insights from the behavioral sciences, this class of behavioral interventions focuses on the design of choice environments that facilitate personally and socially desirable decisions without restricting people in their freedom of choice. Drawing on more than 200 studies reporting over 440 effect sizes (n = 2,148,439), we present a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across techniques, behavioral domains, and contextual study characteristics. Our results show that choice architecture interventions overall promote behavior change with a small to medium effect size of Cohen’s d = 0.43 (95% CI [0.38, 0.48]). In addition, we find that the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions varies significantly as a function of technique and domain. Across behavioral domains, interventions that target the organization and structure of choice alternatives (decision structure) consistently outperform interventions that focus on the description of alternatives (decision information) or the reinforcement of behavioral intentions (decision assistance). Food choices are particularly responsive to choice architecture interventions, with effect sizes up to 2.5 times larger than those in other behavioral domains. Overall, choice architecture interventions affect behavior relatively independently of contextual study characteristics such as the geographical location or the target population of the intervention. Our analysis further reveals a moderate publication bias toward positive results in the literature. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings for theory and behaviorally informed policy making."
40,Arrestin recognizes GPCRs independently of the receptor state,Biochemistry,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate cellular signaling through G proteins and arrestins. While the G protein interactions are well understood, the molecular basis of arrestin recognition remains unclear due to the dynamic nature of GPCR•arrestin complexes. We show that arrestin recognition of the β1-adrenergic receptor occurs independently of the receptor’s conformational state or ligand binding. Using NMR, cryo-EM, and biochemical assays, we find that arrestin engagement is driven by a conformational change within arrestin itself, triggered by a non-receptor-attached phosphopeptide, whereas electrostatic attraction toward receptor phosphosites may only play an auxiliary role. These findings provide insights into arrestin activation and explain its ability to recognize diverse GPCRs, with significant implications for understanding biased signaling mechanisms and designing of selective therapeutic strategies.","Only two nonvisual arrestins recognize many hundreds of different, intracellularly phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Due to the highly dynamic nature of GPCR•arrestin complexes, the critical determinants of GPCR–arrestin recognition have remained largely unclear. We show here that arrestin2 recruitment to the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) can be induced by an arrestin-activating phosphopeptide that is not covalently linked to the receptor and that the recruitment is independent of the presence and type of the orthosteric receptor ligand. Apparently, the arrestin–receptor interaction is driven by the conformational switch within arrestin induced by the phosphopeptide, whereas the electrostatic attraction toward the receptor phosphosites may only play an auxiliary role. Extensive NMR observations show that in contrast to previous static GPCR•arrestin complex structures, the β1AR complex with the beta-blocker carvedilol and arrestin2 is in a G protein-inactive conformation. The insensitivity to the specific receptor conformation provides a rationale for arrestin’s promiscuous recognition of GPCRs and explains the arrestin-biased agonism of carvedilol, which largely blocks G protein binding, while still enabling arrestin engagement."
41,Algorithmic amplification of politics on Twitter,Computer sciences,"The role of social media in political discourse has been the topic of intense scholarly and public debate. Politicians and commentators from all sides allege that Twitter’s algorithms amplify their opponents’ voices, or silence theirs. Policy makers and researchers have thus called for increased transparency on how algorithms influence exposure to political content on the platform. Based on a massive-scale experiment involving millions of Twitter users, a fine-grained analysis of political parties in seven countries, and 6.2 million news articles shared in the United States, this study carries out the most comprehensive audit of an algorithmic recommender system and its effects on political content. Results unveil that the political right enjoys higher amplification compared to the political left.","Content on Twitter’s home timeline is selected and ordered by personalization algorithms. By consistently ranking certain content higher, these algorithms may amplify some messages while reducing the visibility of others. There’s been intense public and scholarly debate about the possibility that some political groups benefit more from algorithmic amplification than others. We provide quantitative evidence from a long-running, massive-scale randomized experiment on the Twitter platform that committed a randomized control group including nearly 2 million daily active accounts to a reverse-chronological content feed free of algorithmic personalization. We present two sets of findings. First, we studied tweets by elected legislators from major political parties in seven countries. Our results reveal a remarkably consistent trend: In six out of seven countries studied, the mainstream political right enjoys higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left. Consistent with this overall trend, our second set of findings studying the US media landscape revealed that algorithmic amplification favors right-leaning news sources. We further looked at whether algorithms amplify far-left and far-right political groups more than moderate ones; contrary to prevailing public belief, we did not find evidence to support this hypothesis. We hope our findings will contribute to an evidence-based debate on the role personalization algorithms play in shaping political content consumption."
42,Natural climate solutions,"Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","Most nations recently agreed to hold global average temperature rise to well below 2 °C. We examine how much climate mitigation nature can contribute to this goal with a comprehensive analysis of “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and/or improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We show that NCS can provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilize warming to below 2 °C. Alongside aggressive fossil fuel emissions reductions, NCS offer a powerful set of options for nations to deliver on the Paris Climate Agreement while improving soil productivity, cleaning our air and water, and maintaining biodiversity.","Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95% CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a >66% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change."
43,Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks,Applied mathematics,"Deep neural networks are currently the most successful machine-learning technique for solving a variety of tasks, including language translation, image classification, and image generation. One weakness of such models is that, unlike humans, they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In this work we propose a practical solution to train such models sequentially by protecting the weights important for previous tasks. This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially.",The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.
44,An RNA-binding regulatory cascade controls the switch from proliferation to differentiation in the Drosophila male germ cell lineage,Developmental biology,"In the stem cell lineages that maintain short-lived specialized cell types and repair many tissues in our body, progenitors proliferate but then must stop dividing and differentiate into the appropriate cell type(s). Proper regulation of the switch from proliferation to differentiation is key to ensure production of sufficient cells to maintain tissues but avoid continued precursor cell proliferation that could progress to cancer. Here, we show that the switch from proliferation to differentiation in the Drosophila male germ line adult stem cell lineage is governed by a cascade of RNA-binding proteins, where the differentiation factor Bag-of Marbles (Bam) down-regulates expression of the RNA-binding protein Held-Out-Wings, homolog of mammalian Quaking, likely by recruiting the CCR4-NOT RNA degradation complex.","The switch from precursor cell proliferation to onset of differentiation in adult stem cell lineages must be carefully regulated to produce sufficient progeny to maintain and repair tissues, yet prevent overproliferation that may enable oncogenesis. In the Drosophila male germ cell lineage, spermatogonia produced by germ line stem cells undergo a limited number of transit amplifying mitotic divisions before switching to the spermatocyte program that sets up meiosis and eventual spermatid differentiation. The number of transit amplifying divisions is set by accumulation of the bag-of-marbles (Bam) protein to a critical threshold. In bam mutants, spermatogonia proliferate through several extra rounds of mitosis and then die without becoming spermatocytes. Here, we show that a key role of Bam for the mitosis to differentiation switch is repressing expression of Held Out Wings (how), homolog of mammalian Quaking. Knockdown of how in germ cells was sufficient to allow spermatogonia mutant for bam or its partner benign gonial cell neoplasm to differentiate, while forced expression of nuclear-targeted How protein in spermatogonia wild-type for bam resulted in continued proliferation at the expense of differentiation. Our findings suggest that Bam targets how RNA for degradation by acting as an adapter to recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex via binding its subunit, Caf40. As How is itself an RNA-binding protein with roles in RNA processing, our findings reveal that the switch from proliferation to meiosis and differentiation in the Drosophila male germ line adult stem cell lineage is regulated by a cascade of RNA-binding proteins."
45,Air pollution and suicide in rural and urban America: Evidence from wildfire smoke,Economic sciences,"Most of the global population is regularly exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution. Emerging evidence suggests that this exposure is not only detrimental to physical health but to mental health as well. Using drifting smoke from wildfires as the basis of a natural experiment in the United States, we provide nationally representative causal evidence that air pollution exposure increases suicide rates, with effects being strongest among rural populations who have a higher baseline risk of suicide and higher exposure to outdoor air. These results provide important insight for identifying and protecting vulnerable groups and for accurately quantifying the full costs of air pollution and wildfires.","Air pollution poses well-established risks to physical health, but little is known about its effects on mental health. We study the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and suicide risk in the United States in 2007 to 2019 using data on all deaths by suicide and satellite-based measures of wildfire smoke and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. We identify the causal effects of wildfire smoke pollution on suicide by relating year-over-year fluctuations in county-level monthly smoke exposure to fluctuations in suicide rates and compare the effects across local areas and demographic groups that differ considerably in their baseline suicide risk. In rural counties, an additional day of smoke increases monthly mean PM2.5 by 0.41 μg/m3 and suicide deaths by 0.11 per million residents, such that a 1-μg/m3 (13%) increase in monthly wildfire-derived fine particulate matter leads to 0.27 additional suicide deaths per million residents (a 2.0% increase). These effects are concentrated among demographic groups with both high baseline suicide risk and high exposure to outdoor air: men, working-age adults, non-Hispanic Whites, and adults with no college education. By contrast, we find no evidence that smoke pollution increases suicide risk among any urban demographic group. This study provides large-scale evidence that air pollution elevates the risk of suicide, disproportionately so among rural populations."
46,Transition ability to safe states reduces fear responses to height,Neuroscience,"Previous studies on fear extinction have relied on repeated exposure to fear-inducing contexts without negative consequences, which gradually constructs a new association between the contexts and nonaversive outcomes. However, fear extinction may also be achieved by predicting that an individual can transition to a safe environment by one’s own actions. Here, by conducting two virtual reality (VR) experiments of height, we examined whether participants’ fear responses to height decrease after actively experiencing a low-altitude VR flight, which enabled them to predict that they would be in a safe state by flying even if they fell from a height. We found that the active flight group exhibited a greater reduction in fear responses, revealing an action-based predictive mechanism for fear extinction.","Previous studies on fear extinction have primarily focused on repeated exposure to fear-inducing context without negative consequences. However, it is also possible that an individual can reduce fear responses by predicting that they can transition to a safe environment through their own actions, even if a fear-inducing context appears. Here, by conducting two virtual reality (VR) experiments (Exp 1 and Exp 2) involving height and flight scenarios, we examined whether participants’ fear responses to height decrease after actively experiencing low-altitude VR flight, which allowed them to predict that they would be in a safe state by flying even if they fell from a height. Specifically, participants in the flight group (n = 44 and 46) flew over a city at altitudes below 5 m for 7 min, while participants in the control group (n = 41 and 28) watched a video of a flight group participant’s experience. Before and after the active flight or passive viewing task, both groups walked on a plank while having their skin conductance response (SCR) and subjective fear score (SFS) measured. In both Exp 1 and Exp 2, the active flight group exhibited a greater reduction in both SCR and SFS compared to the control group. Additionally, a multivariate regression of SCR using the questionnaires collected in Exp 2 revealed that the action-dependent safety prediction has a positive contribution to the SCR reduction in the flight group. These results clarified that the ability to transition to safe states by self-actions can reduce physiological and subjective fear responses."
47,Microscopic basis of reaction center modulation in PsbA variants of photosystem II,Biophysics and computational biology,"The arrangement of macrocyclic pigments within the evolutionarily optimized electrostatic environment of membrane-embedded proteins underlies the function of reaction centers, the sites where the harvested energy of sunlight initiates the electron flow in oxygenic photosynthesis. There are two ways to modulate the physicochemical properties of reaction centers. The first involves substituting a pigment of a certain chemical type with another. The second involves changing the matrix by expressing an alternate isoform of the host protein. This study employs multiscale simulations to explore how three genetic variants of a key reaction center protein in photosystem II influence the optical and redox properties of the pigments critical to the primary processes of oxygenic photosynthesis.","Photosystem II (PSII) is a protein–pigment complex that utilizes sunlight to catalyze water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction, initiating the electron transfer (ET) cascade in oxygenic photosynthesis. The D1 and D2 proteins are the most important transmembrane subunits of PSII that bind all redox-active components involved in primary charge separation (CS) and ET. D1 is susceptible to oxidative photodamage, particularly under high light, and protection partly involves genetic regulation. Cyanobacterial D1 is encoded by the psbA gene family that expresses distinct isoforms (PsbA1–3) depending on environmental conditions. Most differences in D1 isoforms are close to the active-branch reaction center (RC) pigments PD1, PD2, ChlD1, and PheoD1. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with multiscale quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations on the membrane-bound PSII monomer of each variant to compare the redox and excited state properties of RC pigments using long-range-corrected density functional theory. We identify specific amino acid substitutions responsible for electrochromic shifts on distinct pigments and pigment groups. Our results indicate that the PheoD1 acceptor is the primary regulatory target. The redox properties of the ChlD1–PheoD1 pair and the energetics of ChlD1δ+PheoD1δ- charge-transfer states are distinctly modulated in the three isoforms: Compared to the standard psbA1, charge separation is inhibited in psbA2 and facilitated in psbA3 PSII. The results provide a microscopic description of how genetic variations modulate protein electrostatics and influence primary processes in photosynthetic reaction centers."
48,NF-κB-mediated developmental delay extends lifespan in Drosophila,Genetics,"Despite the strong link between animal development and adult lifespan, how developmental programs influence longevity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mutants of the insect neuropeptide hormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) exhibit delayed developmental timing and extended adult lifespan. Intriguingly, PTTH loss reduces innate immune signaling during Drosophila development via the steroid hormone ecdysone. Moreover, temporal and spatial inactivation of developmental innate immune signaling extends both developmental time and lifespan. Our findings reveal a neuropeptide–steroid hormone–immunity axis in lifespan control, offering valuable insights into the role of developmental programs in regulating adult longevity.","Developmental time (or time to maturity) strongly correlates with an animal’s maximum lifespan, with late-maturing individuals often living longer. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. This may be because most previously identified longevity genes regulate growth rate rather than developmental time. To address this gap, we genetically manipulated prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the primary regulator of developmental timing in Drosophila, to explore the genetic link between developmental time and longevity. Loss of PTTH delays developmental timing without altering the growth rate. Intriguingly, PTTH mutants exhibit extended lifespan despite their larger body size. This lifespan extension depends on ecdysone signaling, as feeding 20-hydroxyecdysone to PTTH mutants reverses the effect. Mechanistically, loss of PTTH blunts age-dependent chronic inflammation, specifically in fly hepatocytes (oenocytes). Developmental transcriptomics reveal that NF-κB signaling activates during larva-to-adult transition, with PTTH inducing this signaling via ecdysone. Notably, time-restricted and oenocyte-specific silencing of Relish (an NF-κB homolog) at early 3rd instar larval stages significantly prolongs adult lifespan while delaying pupariation. Our study establishes an aging model that uncouples developmental time from growth rate, highlighting NF-κB signaling as a key developmental program in linking developmental time to adult lifespan."
49,Mitochondrial protein interaction landscape of SS-31,Systems biology,"SS-31 is a synthetic peptide that improves mitochondrial function and is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatments of heart failure, primary mitochondrial myopathy, and other mitochondrial diseases. SS-31 interacts with cardiolipin which is abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but mechanistic details of its pharmacological effects are unknown. Here we apply a chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry method to provide direct evidence for specific interactions between SS-31 and mitochondrial proteins. The identified SS-31 interactors are functional components in ATP production and 2-oxoglutarate metabolism and signaling, consistent with improved mitochondrial function resultant from SS-31 treatment. These results offer a glimpse of the protein interaction landscape of SS-31 and provide mechanistic insight relevant to SS-31 mitochondrial therapy.","Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the etiology of a broad spectrum of diseases including heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and the general aging process. Therapeutics that restore healthy mitochondrial function hold promise for treatment of these conditions. The synthetic tetrapeptide, elamipretide (SS-31), improves mitochondrial function, but mechanistic details of its pharmacological effects are unknown. Reportedly, SS-31 primarily interacts with the phospholipid cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here we utilize chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometry to identify protein interactors of SS-31 in mitochondria. The SS-31-interacting proteins, all known cardiolipin binders, fall into two groups, those involved in ATP production through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and those involved in 2-oxoglutarate metabolic processes. Residues cross-linked with SS-31 reveal binding regions that in many cases, are proximal to cardiolipin–protein interacting regions. These results offer a glimpse of the protein interaction landscape of SS-31 and provide mechanistic insight relevant to SS-31 mitochondrial therapy."
50,US protected lands mismatch biodiversity priorities,Ecology,"The United States has one of the oldest and most sophisticated systems of protected areas in the world. Given the large amount of information on the country’s biodiversity, and the potential resources available, one might expect it to do well in protecting biodiversity. We find that it does not. The United States protected areas do not adequately cover the country’s unique species. To improve the coverage, we map priorities for multiple taxa and recommend specific areas for immediate conservation attention. These areas contain a mix of public and private land, meaning that major progress in conservation will require actions in both the public and private sectors, and will succeed only if done in the correct areas.","Because habitat loss is the main cause of extinction, where and how much society chooses to protect is vital for saving species. The United States is well positioned economically and politically to pursue habitat conservation should it be a societal goal. We assessed the US protected area portfolio with respect to biodiversity in the country. New synthesis maps for terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fish, and trees permit comparison with protected areas to identify priorities for future conservation investment. Although the total area protected is substantial, its geographic configuration is nearly the opposite of patterns of endemism within the country. Most protected lands are in the West, whereas the vulnerable species are largely in the Southeast. Private land protections are significant, but they are not concentrated where the priorities are. To adequately protect the nation’s unique biodiversity, we recommend specific areas deserving additional protection, some of them including public lands, but many others requiring private investment."
51,Identification of the lydiamycin biosynthetic gene cluster in a plant pathogen guides structural revision and identification of molecular target,Microbiology,"There is an urgent requirement to discover new antibiotics. One approach is to use natural products, which are small bioactive molecules that provide producing organisms with beneficial biological traits. Genomic data can be used to rationally identify biosynthetic pathways predicted to make antibiotics. Here, we use genomic data to find that a plant pathogen, Rhodococcus fascians, makes the known antibiotic lydiamycin. Based on our prediction of its biosynthesis, we propose and prove a revised structure for lydiamycin. Genetic data also guided the identification of its molecular target, as well as an ecological role for lydiamycin during plant colonization. Collectively, these data highlight the power of using biosynthetic gene cluster data to identify the structure and function of antibiotics.","The natural products actinonin and matlystatin feature an N-hydroxy-2-pentyl-succinamyl (HPS) chemophore that facilitates metal chelation and confers their metalloproteinase inhibitory activity. Actinonin is the most potent natural inhibitor of peptide deformylase (PDF) and exerts antimicrobial and herbicidal bioactivity by disrupting protein synthesis. Here, we used a genomics-led approach to identify candidate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) hypothesized to produce HPS-containing natural products. We show that one of these BGCs is on the pathogenicity megaplasmid of the plant pathogen Rhodococcus fascians and produces lydiamycin A, a macrocyclic pentapeptide. The presence of genes predicted to make an HPS-like chemophore informed the structural recharacterization of lydiamycin via NMR and crystallography to show that it features a rare 2-pentyl-succinyl chemophore. We demonstrate that lydiamycin A inhibits bacterial PDF in vitro and show that a cluster-situated PDF gene confers resistance to lydiamycin A, representing an uncommon self-immunity mechanism associated with the production of a PDF inhibitor. In planta competition assays showed that lydiamycin enhances the fitness of R. fascians during plant colonization. This study highlights how a BGC can inform the structure, biochemical target, and ecological function of a natural product."
52,"Risk of being killed by police use of force in the United States by age, race–ethnicity, and sex",Medical sciences,"Police violence is a leading cause of death for young men in the United States. Over the life course, about 1 in every 1,000 black men can expect to be killed by police. Risk of being killed by police peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for men and women and for all racial and ethnic groups. Black women and men and American Indian and Alaska Native women and men are significantly more likely than white women and men to be killed by police. Latino men are also more likely to be killed by police than are white men.","We use data on police-involved deaths to estimate how the risk of being killed by police use of force in the United States varies across social groups. We estimate the lifetime and age-specific risks of being killed by police by race and sex. We also provide estimates of the proportion of all deaths accounted for by police use of force. We find that African American men and women, American Indian/Alaska Native men and women, and Latino men face higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. We find that Latina women and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women face lower risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. Risk is highest for black men, who (at current levels of risk) face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the life course. The average lifetime odds of being killed by police are about 1 in 2,000 for men and about 1 in 33,000 for women. Risk peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for all groups. For young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death."
53,"Linked nitrogen and carbon dynamics reveal distinct pools and patterns in a deep, weathered bedrock rhizosphere",Ecology,"In forests, nutrient uptake is assumed to occur almost exclusively in soils. As a key limiting nutrient to plant growth, nitrogen cycling by plant roots and their associated microbes in bedrock has significant implications for deeply rooted ecosystems worldwide. We provide a look at dissolved nitrogen dynamics in a deeply weathered bedrock profile where tree roots extend meters below soil. We show dissolved N in weathered rock is an order of magnitude higher than in soils, primarily organic and derived from plants, not rock. Nitrogen concentrations varied across depth and season. We provide evidence that these patterns are likely driven by rhizosphere activity and leaching and argue that weathered bedrock rhizospheres be considered in future studies on nutrient cycling.","Nitrogen is one of the most limiting nutrients to forest productivity worldwide. Recently, it has been established that diverse ecosystems source a substantial fraction of their water from weathered bedrock, leading to questions about whether root-driven nitrogen cycling extends into weathered bedrock as well. In this study, we specifically examined nitrogen dynamics using specialized instrumentation distributed across a 16 m weathered bedrock vadose zone (WBVZ) underlying an old growth forest in northern California where the rhizosphere—composed of plant roots and their associated microbiome—extends meters into rock. We documented total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), and CO2 and O2 gases every 1.5 m to 16 m depth for 2 y. We found that TDN concentrations increased with depth, were an order of magnitude greater at 15 m than in the upper 30 cm, and that the majority of TDN throughout the weathered bedrock vadose zone was organic. We also found that TDN concentrations are influenced by depth, season, and interannual precipitation patterns. Carbon isotope composition of the DOC suggests that dissolved organic matter in the WBVZ is primarily derived from plant sources, and not the nitrogen-rich bedrock. We conclude that nitrogen dynamics in the WBVZ may be driven, in part, by an active rhizosphere, meters below the base of soil, and we argue that weathered bedrock horizons may play a key role in C-N cycling in ecosystems with deep-rooted plants."
54,Future of the human climate niche,Environmental sciences,"We show that for thousands of years, humans have concentrated in a surprisingly narrow subset of Earth’s available climates, characterized by mean annual temperatures around ∼13 °C. This distribution likely reflects a human temperature niche related to fundamental constraints. We demonstrate that depending on scenarios of population growth and warming, over the coming 50 y, 1 to 3 billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well over the past 6,000 y. Absent climate mitigation or migration, a substantial part of humanity will be exposed to mean annual temperatures warmer than nearly anywhere today.","All species have an environmental niche, and despite technological advances, humans are unlikely to be an exception. Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around ∼11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT >29 °C currently found in only 0.8% of the Earth’s land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation."
55,Interpreting dynamic-compression experiments to uncover the time dependence of freezing: Application to gallium,Applied physical sciences,"We present experiments in which liquid gallium is compressed to 0.3 million times atmospheric pressure within a few hundred nanoseconds. Because of this rapid compression, the gallium sample continues to remain as a metastable liquid at conditions far beyond those expected from the phase diagram of gallium, before it eventually solidifies on the nanosecond timescale of the experiments. We have analyzed our data with computational simulations, and predictions made by our simulations regarding certain experimental signatures motivated additional experiments that later confirmed these predictions. This demonstrates a more accurate diagnosis of delayed solidification in dynamically driven liquids, paving the way for future studies of rapid solidification and comprehensive analyses of experiments aimed at determining equilibrium melt temperatures in extreme conditions.","Using pulsed-power magnetic field sources to compress gallium to gigapascal pressures on nanosecond timescales, we report here experiments on shockless dynamic compression of a liquid metal. Time-resolved velocimetry data reveal signatures of rapid freezing from a metastable liquid state, and we demonstrate that the kinetics of this nonequilibrium solidification can be accurately simulated with a computational modeling framework we have developed in previous studies, where classical nucleation theory is coupled with hydrodynamics. Notably, velocity traces in some of our experiments show evidence of a phase transition, while others do not, even though other types of evidence suggest that solidification may be occurring in all of them. We explain how predictions made by our models regarding the presence or absence of these phase-transition signatures motivated additional experiments that later confirmed the theoretical predictions. Our analysis shows that due to the rapid, quasi-isentropic nature of the loading path, our experiments were able to compress liquid gallium to metastable states that are undercooled below the equilibrium melt temperature by more than 300 K and exhibit pressures that approach five times the equilibrium melt pressure. The understanding gained in this study should form the basis for future dynamic-compression experiments aimed at interrogating melt curves at high pressures."
56,The long-run effects of religious persecution: Evidence from the Spanish Inquisition,Economic sciences,"From Imperial Rome to North Korea, religious persecution entwined with various degrees of totalitarian control has caused conflict and bloodshed for millennia. In this paper, we ask the following: Can religious persecution have repercussions long after it has ceased? Using data on the Spanish Inquisition, we show that in municipalities where the Spanish Inquisition persecuted more citizens, incomes are lower, trust is lower, and education is markedly lower than in other comparable towns and cities. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition to still matter today, but it does.","Religious persecution is common in many countries around the globe. There is little evidence on its long-term effects. We collect data from all across Spain, using information from more than 67,000 trials held by the Spanish Inquisition between 1480 and 1820. This comprehensive database allows us to demonstrate that municipalities of Spain with a history of a stronger inquisitorial presence show lower economic performance, educational attainment, and trust today. The effects persist after controlling for historical indicators of religiosity and wealth, ruling out potential selection bias."
57,Human brain effects of DMT assessed via EEG-fMRI,Neuroscience,"This placebo-controlled multimodal [functional MRI-electroencephalography (fMRI-EEG)] human neuroimaging study offers the most comprehensive view of the acute brain action of psychedelics to date. It assessed N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic that generates immersive altered conscious experience with no diminishment of wakefulness. Global hyperconnectivity, collapsed hierarchical organization and reduced intranetwork integrity, was observed (fMRI) that correlated with decreased alpha power and increased entropy (EEG). Regions with the densest expression of serotonin 2A receptors as determined via independent positron emission tomography (PET) data, were most affected by DMT, and overlapped with regions related to evolved cognitive functions such as language and semantic processing. These results support the notion that psychedelics impact a principal axis of brain organization, and relatedly, the quality of human conscious experience.","Psychedelics have attracted medical interest, but their effects on human brain function are incompletely understood. In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI (electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT. GFC × subjective intensity maps correlated with independent positron emission tomography (PET)-derived 5-HT2AR maps, and both overlapped with meta-analytical data implying human-specific psychological functions. Changes in major EEG-measured neurophysiological properties correlated with specific changes in various fMRI metrics, enriching our understanding of the neural basis of DMT’s effects. The present findings advance on previous work by confirming a predominant action of DMT—and likely other 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics—on the brain’s transmodal association pole, i.e., the neurodevelopmentally and evolutionarily recent cortex that is associated with species-specific psychological advancements, and high expression of 5-HT2A receptors."
58,Nutrient-dense foods and diverse diets are important for ensuring adequate nutrition across the life course,Agricultural sciences,"Many people worldwide have inadequate diets, leading to a high prevalence of malnutrition in all its forms. Several factors prevent people from accessing healthy diets, including socioeconomic and geographic factors. In this paper, we uncover the biological nutritional vulnerabilities stemming from high micronutrient needs per calorie among infants and young children, women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating women, and older adults, particularly older women. To address these vulnerabilities and micronutrient gaps, we highlight the importance of a diverse diet that includes both plant and animal-source foods. We also present the divergent consumption patterns of animal-source foods regionally contributing to nutritional vulnerability.","The world faces a global challenge of how to meet the nutritional needs of a diverse global population through diets. This paper defines the relative nutritional needs across each stage of the life cycle to support human health and identifies who is nutritionally vulnerable. Findings in this paper suggest that there are biological nutritional vulnerabilities stemming from high micronutrient needs per calorie in certain phases of the life cycle, particularly for infants and young children, women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating women, and older adults, particularly older women. The paper demonstrates the role of micronutrient-dense animal-source foods and plant-source foods important in meeting essential nutrient needs to support healthy growth, development, and aging across vulnerable stages of the life cycle."
59,Flynn effect and its reversal are both environmentally caused,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Using administrative register data with information on family relationships and cognitive ability for three decades of Norwegian male birth cohorts, we show that the increase, turning point, and decline of the Flynn effect can be recovered from within-family variation in intelligence scores. This establishes that the large changes in average cohort intelligence reflect environmental factors and not changing composition of parents, which in turn rules out several prominent hypotheses for retrograde Flynn effects.","Population intelligence quotients increased throughout the 20th century—a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect—although recent years have seen a slowdown or reversal of this trend in several countries. To distinguish between the large set of proposed explanations, we categorize hypothesized causal factors by whether they accommodate the existence of within-family Flynn effects. Using administrative register data and cognitive ability scores from military conscription data covering three decades of Norwegian birth cohorts (1962–1991), we show that the observed Flynn effect, its turning point, and subsequent decline can all be fully recovered from within-family variation. The analysis controls for all factors shared by siblings and finds no evidence for prominent causal hypotheses of the decline implicating genes and environmental factors that vary between, but not within, families."
60,Sex differences in the structural connectome of the human brain,Neuroscience,"Sex differences are of high scientific and societal interest because of their prominence in behavior of humans and nonhuman species. This work is highly significant because it studies a very large population of 949 youths (8–22 y, 428 males and 521 females) using the diffusion-based structural connectome of the brain, identifying novel sex differences. The results establish that male brains are optimized for intrahemispheric and female brains for interhemispheric communication. The developmental trajectories of males and females separate at a young age, demonstrating wide differences during adolescence and adulthood. The observations suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.","Sex differences in human behavior show adaptive complementarity: Males have better motor and spatial abilities, whereas females have superior memory and social cognition skills. Studies also show sex differences in human brains but do not explain this complementarity. In this work, we modeled the structural connectome using diffusion tensor imaging in a sample of 949 youths (aged 8–22 y, 428 males and 521 females) and discovered unique sex differences in brain connectivity during the course of development. Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well as analysis of regional and global network measures, presented a comprehensive description of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions, males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity, as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity, whereas between-hemispheric connectivity and cross-module participation predominated in females. However, this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes."
61,A Turing test of whether AI chatbots are behaviorally similar to humans,Economic sciences,"As AI interacts with humans on an increasing array of tasks, it is important to understand how it behaves. Since much of AI programming is proprietary, developing methods of assessing AI by observing its behaviors is essential. We develop a Turing test to assess the behavioral and personality traits exhibited by AI. Beyond administering a personality test, we have ChatGPT variants play games that are benchmarks for assessing traits: trust, fairness, risk-aversion, altruism, and cooperation. Their behaviors fall within the distribution of behaviors of humans and exhibit patterns consistent with learning. When deviating from mean and modal human behaviors, they are more cooperative and altruistic. This is a step in developing assessments of AI as it increasingly influences human experiences.","We administer a Turing test to AI chatbots. We examine how chatbots behave in a suite of classic behavioral games that are designed to elicit characteristics such as trust, fairness, risk-aversion, cooperation, etc., as well as how they respond to a traditional Big-5 psychological survey that measures personality traits. ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits that are statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousands of human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify their behavior based on previous experience and contexts “as if” they were learning from the interactions and change their behavior in response to different framings of the same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinct from average and modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave on the more altruistic and cooperative end of the distribution. We estimate that they act as if they are maximizing an average of their own and partner’s payoffs."
62,Motor imagery enhances performance beyond the imagined action,Neuroscience ,"Specific cueing movements embedded within a sequence can influence execution and learning of individual segments. We investigated whether the facilitative effect of linked prior movements could also be achieved by imagining the prior movements. Indeed, motor imagery of prior reaching movements allowed motor learning in an established motor adaptation paradigm. Our results go beyond a simple demonstration that motor imagery resembles performance of an actual movement in the brain by showing that imagined movements can also enhance performance of different linked movements. In addition, we show that the strength of neural activity during a basic motor imagery task is associated with motor adaptation. Our results indicate effective use cases of motor imagery in sports and rehabilitation.","Motor imagery is frequently utilized to improve the performance of specific target movements in sports and rehabilitation. In this study, we show that motor imagery can facilitate learning of not only the imagined target movements but also sequentially linked overt movements. Hybrid sequences comprising imagined and physically executed segments allowed participants to learn specific movement characteristics of the executed segments when they were consistently associated with specific imagined segments. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the degree of event-related synchronization in the alpha and beta bands during a basic motor imagery task was correlated with imagery-evoked motor learning. Thus, both behavioral and neural evidence indicate that motor imagery’s benefits extend beyond the imagined movements, improving performance in linked overt movements. This provides decisive evidence for the functional equivalence of imagined and overt movements and suggests applications for imagery in sports and rehabilitation."
63,Modeling the dynamics of aeolian meter-scale bedforms induced by bed heterogeneities,"Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","We present a model to explain the emergence of meter-scale bedforms that grow in coarse-grained interdune areas or on moist beaches. We show that the existing theory of dune dynamics must be extended to account for the spatial variation of wind transport capacity over bed heterogeneities, with enhanced transport over consolidated rather than erodible surfaces. The quantitative agreement between the model predictions and a unique set of high-precision field data acquired in the Namib Desert allows us to theoretically explore the different dynamics of such emerging bedforms, which can eventually disappear or lead to dune formation. This work provides ways to interpret the initiation and evolution of small bedforms, and facilitates the estimation of aeolian transport in diverse environments.","Desert surfaces are typically nonuniform, with individual sand dunes generally surrounded by gravel or nonerodible beds. Similarly, beaches vary in composition and moisture that enhances cohesion between the grains. These bed heterogeneities affect the aeolian transport properties greatly and can then influence the emergence and dynamics of bedforms. Here, we propose a model that describes how, due to transport capacity being greater on consolidated than erodible beds, patches of sand can grow, migrate, and spread to form bedforms with meter-scale length. Our approach has a quantitative agreement with high-resolution spatiotemporal observations, where conventional theory would predict the disappearance of these small bedforms. A crucial component of the model is that the transport capacity does not instantly change from one bed configuration to another. Instead, transport capacity develops over a certain distance, which thereby determines the short-term evolution of the bedform. The model predicts various stages in the development of these meter-scale bedforms, and explains how the evolution of bed elevation profiles observed in the field depends on the duration of the wind event and the intensity of the incoming sand flux. Our study thus sheds light on the initiation and dynamics of early-stage bedforms by establishing links between surface properties, emerging sand patterns, and protodunes, commonly observed in coastal and desert landscapes."
64,Structure and evolution of photosystem I in the early-branching cyanobacterium Anthocerotibacter panamensis,Plant biology,"Photosystem I (PSI) is a light-driven oxidoreductase protein complex essential to all oxygenic phototrophs. While PSI typically resides in thylakoid membranes, early-branching cyanobacteria without thylakoids localize PSI in the cytoplasmic membrane, making these organisms crucial for evolutionary studies. Previous research has focused on a single thylakoid-free species, Gloeobacter violaceus, limiting insights into the early diversification of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. To fill this gap, we analyzed PSI in Anthocerotibacter panamensis, a thylakoid-free cyanobacterium that diverged from Gloeobacter spp. ~1.4 billion years ago. A. panamensis PSI retains ancestral traits absent in G. violaceus while also exhibiting unique features distinct from both G. violaceus and thylakoid-containing cyanobacteria. These findings highlight A. panamensis as a critical model for understanding PSI evolution and photosynthetic diversification.","Thylakoid-free cyanobacteria are thought to preserve ancestral traits of early-evolving organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, and until recently, photosynthesis studies in thylakoid-free cyanobacteria were only possible in the model strain Gloeobacter violaceus, limiting our understanding of photosynthesis evolution. Here, we report the isolation, biochemical characterization, cryo-EM structure, and phylogenetic analysis of photosystem I (PSI) from a recently discovered thylakoid-free cyanobacterium, Anthocerotibacter panamensis, a distant relative of the genus Gloeobacter. We find that A. panamensis PSI exhibits a distinct carotenoid composition and has one conserved low-energy chlorophyll site, which was lost in G. violaceus. Furthermore, PSI in thylakoid-free cyanobacteria has changed at the sequence level to a degree comparable to that of other strains, yet its subunit composition and oligomeric form might be identical to that of the most recent common ancestor of cyanobacteria. This study therefore provides a glimpse into the ancient evolution of photosynthesis."
65,Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic,Neuroscience,"Sex/gender differences in the brain are of high social interest because their presence is typically assumed to prove that humans belong to two distinct categories not only in terms of their genitalia, and thus justify differential treatment of males and females. Here we show that, although there are sex/gender differences in brain and behavior, humans and human brains are comprised of unique “mosaics” of features, some more common in females compared with males, some more common in males compared with females, and some common in both females and males. Our results demonstrate that regardless of the cause of observed sex/gender differences in brain and behavior (nature or nurture), human brains cannot be categorized into two distinct classes: male brain/female brain.","Whereas a categorical difference in the genitals has always been acknowledged, the question of how far these categories extend into human biology is still not resolved. Documented sex/gender differences in the brain are often taken as support of a sexually dimorphic view of human brains (“female brain” or “male brain”). However, such a distinction would be possible only if sex/gender differences in brain features were highly dimorphic (i.e., little overlap between the forms of these features in males and females) and internally consistent (i.e., a brain has only “male” or only “female” features). Here, analysis of MRIs of more than 1,400 human brains from four datasets reveals extensive overlap between the distributions of females and males for all gray matter, white matter, and connections assessed. Moreover, analyses of internal consistency reveal that brains with features that are consistently at one end of the “maleness-femaleness” continuum are rare. Rather, most brains are comprised of unique “mosaics” of features, some more common in females compared with males, some more common in males compared with females, and some common in both females and males. Our findings are robust across sample, age, type of MRI, and method of analysis. These findings are corroborated by a similar analysis of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviors of more than 5,500 individuals, which reveals that internal consistency is extremely rare. Our study demonstrates that, although there are sex/gender differences in the brain, human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories: male brain/female brain."
66,Theory and observations of the interaction between magnetohydrodynamic waves and shocks,"Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","Shocks are ubiquitous in space and laboratory plasmas, forming in supernova explosions, stellar and solar wind terminations, interplanetary transients, and fusion experiments, where the preexisting waves interact with the shock front. These wave–shock interactions lead to wave transmission, reflection, and perturbations of the shock front, influencing energy dissipation and particle acceleration. We directly apply a theoretical model of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave transmission across shocks to in-situ spacecraft observations of an interplanetary fast shock at 1 AU. By quantitatively comparing observed spectra of magnetic field, velocity, and density fluctuations with theoretical predictions, we validate key aspects of MHD wave transmission theory. Our findings have broad implications for astrophysical shock dynamics and controlled plasma experiments.","The interaction between interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shock and upstream magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves (hereafter referred to as wave–shock interactions) is of fundamental importance to plasma physics. Linear waves and shocks, which are supported by MHD framework, are ubiquitous in almost all plasma environments. A thorough understanding of the interaction between linear waves and shocks is useful not only for heliophysics and astrophysics but also for other applications such as inertial confinement fusion. We revisit the theoretical problem of shock-wave interaction based on the linearized boundary conditions of MHD. The shock is regarded as an ideal discontinuity and individual wave modes are considered to impact the shock from upstream. The wavevectors and amplitudes of the downstream transmitted waves are calculated. We further develop a method to apply the theory directly to in-situ heliospheric shock observations. The validity of the method is demonstrated through the example of a fast-forward interplanetary shock observed at 1 AU."
67,Nanoimmunomodulation of the Aβ-STING feedback machinery in microglia for Alzheimer’s disease treatment,Pharmacology,"Anti-Aβ therapeutics provide only temporary symptom relief in AD while introducing proinflammatory side effects. We describe an “Aβ-STING” immune feedback loop that contributes to AD pathology and, building upon this discovery, introduce a nanomedicine approach: Aβ-STING Synergistic ImmunoSilencing Therapy (ASSIST), to cross the blood–brain barrier and disrupt this maladaptive feedback. ASSIST dissociates Aβ aggregates via a multivalent interaction mechanism, promoting their selective uptake by microglia while simultaneously preventing aberrant cGAS–STING signaling from excessive Aβ engulfment. This preserves microglial homeostasis and optimizes their capacity for ongoing Aβ clearance. Systemic administration of ASSIST significantly improves cognitive function in AD mice with minimal risk of neuroinflammation. This work provides proof-of-concept for exploiting the synergy between Aβ and STING in AD treatment.","Imbalanced production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While several monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ have shown reductions in amyloid burden, their impact on cognitive function remains controversial, with the added risk of inflammatory side effects. Dysregulated stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, yet the biological interaction between this pathway and Aβ, as well as their combined influence on AD progression, is poorly understood. Here, we show that while microglia play a protective role in clearing extracellular Aβ, excessive Aβ engulfment triggers the cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA for cGAS–STING cascade. This creates a negative feedback loop that not only exacerbates neuroinflammation but also impairs further Aβ clearance. To address this, we present a nanomedicine approach termed “Aβ-STING Synergistic ImmunoSilencing Therapy (ASSIST)”. ASSIST comprises STING inhibitors encapsulated within a blood–brain barrier (BBB)-permeable polymeric micelle that also serves as an Aβ scavenger. Through a multivalent interaction mechanism, ASSIST efficiently destabilizes Aβ plaques and prevents monomer aggregation, subsequently promoting the engulfment of the dissociated Aβ by microglia rather than neurocytes. Furthermore, the STING signaling induced by excessive Aβ uptake is blocked, reducing inflammation and restoring microglial homeostatic functions involved in Aβ clearance. Intravenous administration of ASSIST significantly reduces Aβ burden and improves cognition in AD mice, with minimal cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microhemorrhages. We provide a proof-of-concept nanoengineering strategy to target the maladaptive immune feedback loop arising from conventional immunotherapy for AD treatment."
68,MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors from cofactor-directed DNA-encoded library screens,Pharmacology,"The methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene is recurrently lost in human cancers. A methylthioadenosine (MTA)-directed DNA-encoded library screening strategy was employed to identify MTA-cooperative PRMT5 binders, leading to development of AM-9934. AM-9934 inhibits PRMT5 only in the presence of MTA and selectively impairs proliferation of MTAP -deleted cancer cells and growth of MTAP−/− tumors while sparing MTAP+/+ cells.","Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene deletions are frequent in human cancers. Loss of MTAP leads to significantly increased cellular levels of methylthioadenosine (MTA), a cellular metabolite and specific inhibitor of the cell-essential enzyme Protein Arginine Methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5). Using a cofactor-directed screening strategy and DNA-encoded libraries, we identify a class of PRMT5 inhibitors that cooperatively inhibit PRMT5 in the presence of MTA. An optimized inhibitor, AM-9934, selectively inhibits PRMT5 in MTAP-deleted cells and in transplanted tumors while sparing MTAP-expressing counterparts, leading to specific suppression of viability in MTAP-deleted cells. Structural studies show that AM-9934 occupies the arginine substrate pocket of MTA-bound PRMT5. This study introduces a broadly applicable method for directed DNA-encoded library screening toward a desired mechanistic outcome and highlights MTA-selective PRMT5 inhibition as an attractive therapeutic strategy with a potentially broad therapeutic index in patients with MTAP-deleted cancers."
69,Robust evidence for bisexual orientation among men,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"There has long been skepticism among both scientists and laypersons that male bisexual orientation exists. Skeptics have claimed that men who self-identify as bisexual are actually homosexual or heterosexual. (The existence of female bisexuality has been less controversial.) This controversy can be resolved using objective, genital responses of men to male and female erotic stimuli. We combined nearly all available data (from eight previous American, British, and Canadian studies) to form a dataset of more than 500 men, much larger than any previous individual study, and conducted rigorous statistical tests. Results provided compelling evidence that bisexual-identified men tend to show bisexual genital and subjective arousal patterns. Male sexual orientation is expressed on a continuum rather than dichotomously.","The question whether some men have a bisexual orientation—that is, whether they are substantially sexually aroused and attracted to both sexes—has remained controversial among both scientists and laypersons. Skeptics believe that male sexual orientation can only be homosexual or heterosexual, and that bisexual identification reflects nonsexual concerns, such as a desire to deemphasize homosexuality. Although most bisexual-identified men report that they are attracted to both men and women, self-report data cannot refute these claims. Patterns of physiological (genital) arousal to male and female erotic stimuli can provide compelling evidence for male sexual orientation. (In contrast, most women provide similar physiological responses to male and female stimuli.) We investigated whether men who self-report bisexual feelings tend to produce bisexual arousal patterns. Prior studies of this issue have been small, used potentially invalid statistical tests, and produced inconsistent findings. We combined nearly all previously published data (from eight previous studies in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada), yielding a sample of 474 to 588 men (depending on analysis). All participants were cisgender males. Highly robust results showed that bisexual-identified men’s genital and subjective arousal patterns were more bisexual than were those who identified as exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. These findings support the view that male sexual orientation contains a range, from heterosexuality, to bisexuality, to homosexuality."
70,Kernels of selfhood: GPT-4o shows humanlike patterns of cognitive dissonance moderated by free choice,Computer sciences,"Scientists have long promised that AI will make more rational decisions than even expert humans. These studies show that this is not a foregone conclusion because large language models (LLMs) already appear to have acquired humanlike irrationalities. We demonstrate that GPT-4o displays behaviors consistent with cognitive dissonance, a deep and not always rational feature of human cognition. Moreover, the effect sizes obtained with GPT-4o were significantly larger than those typically obtained with humans. Most strikingly, the observed effects were greater when GPT was led to believe that it was exercising free choice in the completion of the dissonance-inducing task, an effect associated with human self-referential processing. We conclude that the LLM has developed an analog form of humanlike cognitive selfhood.","Large language models (LLMs) show emergent patterns that mimic human cognition. We explore whether they also mirror other, less deliberative human psychological processes. Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies tested whether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive or negative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitude change mimicking cognitive dissonance effects in humans. Even more remarkably, the degree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice about which essay (positive or negative) to write, suggesting that GPT-4o manifests a functional analog of humanlike selfhood. The exact mechanisms by which the model mimics human attitude change and self-referential processing remain to be understood."
71,Reconciling modern machine-learning practice and the classical bias–variance trade-off,Statistics,"While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms.","Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning."
72,Characterization and engineering of a plastic-degrading aromatic polyesterase,Biochemistry,"Synthetic polymers are ubiquitous in the modern world but pose a global environmental problem. While plastics such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are highly versatile, their resistance to natural degradation presents a serious, growing risk to fauna and flora, particularly in marine environments. Here, we have characterized the 3D structure of a newly discovered enzyme that can digest highly crystalline PET, the primary material used in the manufacture of single-use plastic beverage bottles, in some clothing, and in carpets. We engineer this enzyme for improved PET degradation capacity and further demonstrate that it can also degrade an important PET replacement, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate, providing new opportunities for biobased plastics recycling.","Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced synthetic polymers and is accumulating in the environment at a staggering rate as discarded packaging and textiles. The properties that make PET so useful also endow it with an alarming resistance to biodegradation, likely lasting centuries in the environment. Our collective reliance on PET and other plastics means that this buildup will continue unless solutions are found. Recently, a newly discovered bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was shown to exhibit the rare ability to grow on PET as a major carbon and energy source. Central to its PET biodegradation capability is a secreted PETase (PET-digesting enzyme). Here, we present a 0.92 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of PETase, which reveals features common to both cutinases and lipases. PETase retains the ancestral α/β-hydrolase fold but exhibits a more open active-site cleft than homologous cutinases. By narrowing the binding cleft via mutation of two active-site residues to conserved amino acids in cutinases, we surprisingly observe improved PET degradation, suggesting that PETase is not fully optimized for crystalline PET degradation, despite presumably evolving in a PET-rich environment. Additionally, we show that PETase degrades another semiaromatic polyester, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), which is an emerging, bioderived PET replacement with improved barrier properties. In contrast, PETase does not degrade aliphatic polyesters, suggesting that it is generally an aromatic polyesterase. These findings suggest that additional protein engineering to increase PETase performance is realistic and highlight the need for further developments of structure/activity relationships for biodegradation of synthetic polyesters."
73,Transcranial direct current stimulation neuromodulates intracranial cognitive evoked activity in humans,Neuroscience,"A sham-controlled transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiment was performed simultaneously with intracranial electroencephalographic recording (iEEG) and fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) in epileptic patients. General visual and face-selective iEEG responses evoked by FPVS were quantified before, during, and after a single session of anodal tDCS performed over the right posterior temporal lobe (PTL) using small ring electrodes. Significant amplitude increases of face-selective iEEG responses were observed during tDCS, whereas weak neuromodulation occurred on general visual responses. The neuromodulations were observed in the PTL. Finally, and interestingly, the neuromodulation remained after a single tDCS session. This study shows that objective, selective, and significant neuromodulation can be obtained using small electrodes and low intensity with tDCS.","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an easy to use, noninvasive brain stimulation technique that gained prominence for its potential in cognitive rehabilitation. Electroencephalography (EEG), which records electrical brain activity with a high temporal resolution, is well suited to quantify tDCS-induced neuromodulation in humans. However, most studies relying on scalp EEG recordings or event-related potentials showed low reliability and only indirect correlations. Here, we combined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings with a sham-controlled tDCS experiment during fast periodic visual stimulation. Anodal (+2 mA) tDCS was applied over the right occipito-temporal cortex for 20 min using two small ring high-definition electrodes. Through the analysis of iEEG signals of 947 intracerebral contacts in 11 drug-resistant epileptic patients, we quantified the neuromodulation of iEEG cognitive evoked responses during (P2 phase) and after (P3 phase) tDCS by comparison to a control phase before tDCS (P1 phase). Significant neuromodulations of face-selective iEEG activity in anterior & posterior temporal lobe and in the occipital lobe were found, with amplitude increases of 3% and 4%, 16% and 13%, and 36% and 33%, during and after tDCS, respectively. Interestingly, despite a unique tDCS session, the face-selective neuromodulation in the right visual occipito-temporal cortex remained significant (P = 0.015) after tDCS (P3 vs. P1). This iEEG study demonstrates that using low intensity tDCS and small ring electrodes can induce significant electrophysiological effects on a selective cognitive function in humans."
74,Temperature increase reduces global yields of major crops in four independent estimates,Agricultural sciences,"Agricultural production is vulnerable to climate change. Understanding climate change, especially the temperature impacts, is critical if policymakers, agriculturalists, and crop breeders are to ensure global food security. Our study, by compiling extensive published results from four analytical methods, shows that independent methods consistently estimated negative temperature impacts on yields of four major crops at the global scale, generally underpinned by similar impacts at country and site scales. Multimethod analyses improved the confidence in assessments of future climate impacts on global major crops, with important implications for developing crop- and region-specific adaptation strategies to ensure future food supply of an increasing world population.","Wheat, rice, maize, and soybean provide two-thirds of human caloric intake. Assessing the impact of global temperature increase on production of these crops is therefore critical to maintaining global food supply, but different studies have yielded different results. Here, we investigated the impacts of temperature on yields of the four crops by compiling extensive published results from four analytical methods: global grid-based and local point-based models, statistical regressions, and field-warming experiments. Results from the different methods consistently showed negative temperature impacts on crop yield at the global scale, generally underpinned by similar impacts at country and site scales. Without CO2 fertilization, effective adaptation, and genetic improvement, each degree-Celsius increase in global mean temperature would, on average, reduce global yields of wheat by 6.0%, rice by 3.2%, maize by 7.4%, and soybean by 3.1%. Results are highly heterogeneous across crops and geographical areas, with some positive impact estimates. Multimethod analyses improved the confidence in assessments of future climate impacts on global major crops and suggest crop- and region-specific adaptation strategies to ensure food security for an increasing world population."
75,Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,Economic sciences,"Attempts at modifying public opinions, attitudes, and beliefs range from advertising and schooling to “brainwashing.” Their effectiveness is highly controversial. We demonstrate that Nazi indoctrination––with its singular focus on fostering racial hatred––was highly effective. Germans who grew up under the Nazi regime are much more anti-Semitic today than those born before or after that period. These findings demonstrate that beliefs can be modified massively through policy intervention. We also show that it was probably Nazi schooling that was most effective, and not radio or cinema propaganda. Where schooling could tap into preexisting prejudices, indoctrination was particularly strong. This suggests that confirmation bias may play an important role in intensifying attitudes toward minorities.","Attempts at modifying public opinions, attitudes, and beliefs range from advertising and schooling to “brainwashing.” Their effectiveness is highly controversial. In this paper, we use survey data on anti-Semitic beliefs and attitudes in a representative sample of Germans surveyed in 1996 and 2006 to show that Nazi indoctrination––with its singular focus on fostering racial hatred––was highly effective. Between 1933 and 1945, young Germans were exposed to anti-Semitic ideology in schools, in the (extracurricular) Hitler Youth, and through radio, print, and film. As a result, Germans who grew up under the Nazi regime are much more anti-Semitic than those born before or after that period: the share of committed anti-Semites, who answer a host of questions about attitudes toward Jews in an extreme fashion, is 2–3 times higher than in the population as a whole. Results also hold for average beliefs, and not just the share of extremists; average views of Jews are much more negative among those born in the 1920s and 1930s. Nazi indoctrination was most effective where it could tap into preexisting prejudices; those born in districts that supported anti-Semitic parties before 1914 show the greatest increases in anti-Jewish attitudes. These findings demonstrate the extent to which beliefs can be modified through policy intervention. We also identify parameters amplifying the effectiveness of such measures, such as preexisting prejudices."
76,Out-group animosity drives engagement on social media,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Almost four billion people around the world now use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and social media is one of the primary ways people access news or receive communications from politicians. However, social media may be creating perverse incentives for divisive content because this content is particularly likely to go “viral.” We report evidence that posts about political opponents are substantially more likely to be shared on social media and that this out-group effect is much stronger than other established predictors of social media sharing, such as emotional language. These findings contribute to scholarly debates about the role of social media in political polarization and can inform solutions for creating healthier social media environments.","There has been growing concern about the role social media plays in political polarization. We investigated whether out-group animosity was particularly successful at generating engagement on two of the largest social media platforms: Facebook and Twitter. Analyzing posts from news media accounts and US congressional members (n = 2,730,215), we found that posts about the political out-group were shared or retweeted about twice as often as posts about the in-group. Each individual term referring to the political out-group increased the odds of a social media post being shared by 67%. Out-group language consistently emerged as the strongest predictor of shares and retweets: the average effect size of out-group language was about 4.8 times as strong as that of negative affect language and about 6.7 times as strong as that of moral-emotional language—both established predictors of social media engagement. Language about the out-group was a very strong predictor of “angry” reactions (the most popular reactions across all datasets), and language about the in-group was a strong predictor of “love” reactions, reflecting in-group favoritism and out-group derogation. This out-group effect was not moderated by political orientation or social media platform, but stronger effects were found among political leaders than among news media accounts. In sum, out-group language is the strongest predictor of social media engagement across all relevant predictors measured, suggesting that social media may be creating perverse incentives for content expressing out-group animosity."
77,GPT is an effective tool for multilingual psychological text analysis,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Many fields—including psychology, sociology, communications, political science, and computer science—use computational methods to analyze text data. However, existing text analysis methods have a number of shortcomings. Dictionary methods, while easy to use, are often not very accurate when compared to recent methods. Machine learning models, while more accurate, can be difficult to train and use. We demonstrate that the large-language model GPT is capable of accurately detecting various psychological constructs (as judged by manual annotators) in text across 12 languages, using simple prompts and no additional training data. GPT thus overcomes the limitations present in existing methods. GPT is also effective in several lesser-spoken languages, which could facilitate text analysis research from understudied contexts.","The social and behavioral sciences have been increasingly using automated text analysis to measure psychological constructs in text. We explore whether GPT, the large-language model (LLM) underlying the AI chatbot ChatGPT, can be used as a tool for automated psychological text analysis in several languages. Across 15 datasets (n = 47,925 manually annotated tweets and news headlines), we tested whether different versions of GPT (3.5 Turbo, 4, and 4 Turbo) can accurately detect psychological constructs (sentiment, discrete emotions, offensiveness, and moral foundations) across 12 languages. We found that GPT (r = 0.59 to 0.77) performed much better than English-language dictionary analysis (r = 0.20 to 0.30) at detecting psychological constructs as judged by manual annotators. GPT performed nearly as well as, and sometimes better than, several top-performing fine-tuned machine learning models. Moreover, GPT’s performance improved across successive versions of the model, particularly for lesser-spoken languages, and became less expensive. Overall, GPT may be superior to many existing methods of automated text analysis, since it achieves relatively high accuracy across many languages, requires no training data, and is easy to use with simple prompts (e.g., “is this text negative?”) and little coding experience. We provide sample code and a video tutorial for analyzing text with the GPT application programming interface. We argue that GPT and other LLMs help democratize automated text analysis by making advanced natural language processing capabilities more accessible, and may help facilitate more cross-linguistic research with understudied languages."
78,Sex bias in pain management decisions,Medical sciences,"Pain treatment must be provided adequately and impartially. Here, we conduct an analysis of archival datasets of pain management decisions as well as a controlled experiment, testing whether pain management differs by patients’ sex. We present robust evidence showing that physicians’ and nurses’ pain management decisions in emergency departments disfavor female patients compared to male patients. Notably, female patients are less likely than males to be prescribed pain-relief medications for the same complaints. We argue that female patients receive less pain treatment than they should, which may adversely impact their health. The findings underscore the critical need to address psychological biases in healthcare settings to ensure fair and efficient treatment for all.","In the pursuit of mental and physical health, effective pain management stands as a cornerstone. Here, we examine a potential sex bias in pain management. Leveraging insights from psychological research showing that females’ pain is stereotypically judged as less intense than males’ pain, we hypothesize that there may be tangible differences in pain management decisions based on patients’ sex. Our investigation spans emergency department (ED) datasets from two countries, including discharge notes of patients arriving with pain complaints (N = 21,851). Across these datasets, a consistent sex disparity emerges. Female patients are less likely to be prescribed pain-relief medications compared to males, and this disparity persists even after adjusting for patients’ reported pain scores and numerous patient, physician, and ED variables. This disparity extends across medical practitioners, with both male and female physicians prescribing less pain-relief medications to females than to males. Additional analyses reveal that female patients’ pain scores are 10% less likely to be recorded by nurses, and female patients spend an additional 30 min in the ED compared to male patients. A controlled experiment employing clinical vignettes reinforces our hypothesis, showing that nurses (N = 109) judge pain of female patients to be less intense than that of males. We argue that the findings reflect an undertreatment of female patients’ pain. We discuss the troubling societal and medical implications of females’ pain being overlooked and call for policy interventions to ensure equal pain treatment."
79,"Distinct XPPX sequence motifs induce ribosome stalling, which is rescued by the translation elongation factor EF-P",Biochemistry,"During protein synthesis, ribosomes catalyze peptide-bond formation between amino acids with differing efficiency. We show that two or more consecutive prolines induce ribosome stalling, and that stalling strength is influenced by the amino acid preceding and following the prolines. In bacteria, the elongation factor EF-P efficiently rescues the ribosome stalling irrespective of the XPP or PPX motif.","Ribosomes are the protein synthesizing factories of the cell, polymerizing polypeptide chains from their constituent amino acids. However, distinct combinations of amino acids, such as polyproline stretches, cannot be efficiently polymerized by ribosomes, leading to translational stalling. The stalled ribosomes are rescued by the translational elongation factor P (EF-P), which by stimulating peptide-bond formation allows translation to resume. Using metabolic stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate in vivo that EF-P is important for expression of not only polyproline-containing proteins, but also for specific subsets of proteins containing diprolyl motifs (XPP/PPX). Together with a systematic in vitro and in vivo analysis, we provide a distinct hierarchy of stalling triplets, ranging from strong stallers, such as PPP, DPP, and PPN to weak stallers, such as CPP, PPR, and PPH, all of which are substrates for EF-P. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the characteristics of the specific amino acid substrates influence the fundamentals of peptide bond formation."
80,Pliocene and Eocene provide best analogs for near-future climates,"Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","The expected departure of future climates from those experienced in human history challenges efforts to adapt. Possible analogs to climates from deep in Earth’s geological past have been suggested but not formally assessed. We compare climates of the coming decades with climates drawn from six geological and historical periods spanning the past 50 My. Our study suggests that climates like those of the Pliocene will prevail as soon as 2030 CE and persist under climate stabilization scenarios. Unmitigated scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions produce climates like those of the Eocene, which suggests that we are effectively rewinding the climate clock by approximately 50 My, reversing a multimillion year cooling trend in less than two centuries.","As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129–116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 CE), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in RCP4.5 (<1%) but reach 8.7% of the globe under RCP8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, RCP4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as RCP8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity."
81,Therapeutic targeting of HER2–CB2R heteromers in HER2-positive breast cancer,Pharmacology,"There is a subtype of breast cancer characterized by the overexpression of the oncogene HER2. Although most patients with this diagnosis benefit from HER2-targeted treatments, some do not respond to these therapies and others develop resistance with time. New tools are therefore warranted for the treatment of this patient population, and for early identification of those individuals at a higher risk of developing innate or acquired resistance to current treatments. Here, we show that HER2 forms heteromer complexes with the cannabinoid receptor CB2R, the expression of these structures correlates with poor patient prognosis, and their disruption promotes antitumor responses. Collectively, our results support HER2–CB2R heteromers as new therapeutic targets and prognostic tools in HER2+ breast cancer.","Although human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies have dramatically improved the clinical outcome of HER2-positive breast cancer patients, innate and acquired resistance remains an important clinical challenge. New therapeutic approaches and diagnostic tools for identification, stratification, and treatment of patients at higher risk of resistance and recurrence are therefore warranted. Here, we unveil a mechanism controlling the oncogenic activity of HER2: heteromerization with the cannabinoid receptor CB2R. We show that HER2 physically interacts with CB2R in breast cancer cells, and that the expression of these heteromers correlates with poor patient prognosis. The cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) disrupts HER2–CB2R complexes by selectively binding to CB2R, which leads to (i) the inactivation of HER2 through disruption of HER2–HER2 homodimers, and (ii) the subsequent degradation of HER2 by the proteasome via the E3 ligase c-CBL. This in turn triggers antitumor responses in vitro and in vivo. Selective targeting of CB2R transmembrane region 5 mimicked THC effects. Together, these findings define HER2–CB2R heteromers as new potential targets for antitumor therapies and biomarkers with prognostic value in HER2-positive breast cancer."
82,Can AI weather models predict out-of-distribution gray swan tropical cyclones?,"Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","AI models produce skillful weather forecasts, including for some extreme events. However, forecasting the strongest events that are so rare they did not exist in the training set (the so-called gray swans) remains a major concern for these models’ operational use, especially as climate change introduces unprecedented conditions. Here, we train an AI weather model after removing Category 3–5 tropical cyclones from its training set and test it on Category 5 storms. The model could not accurately forecast these unseen cyclones. However, the model shows promise in learning from strong storms in one region and forecasting them in another region. Our work highlights the need for better understanding the limitations of AI weather models and innovations to improve them.","Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather models and long-term climate emulators. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI weather model FourCastNet on the 1979–2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3–5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018–2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3–5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3–5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather and climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models. Other types of weather extremes need to be similarly investigated. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI models to reliably provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful TCs, and, possibly, other weather extremes."
83,Lipid nanoparticle-mediated lymph node–targeting delivery of mRNA cancer vaccine elicits robust CD8+ T cell response,Chemistry,"Current messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in the clinic were reported to induce side effects in the liver, such as reversible hepatic damages and T cell–dominant immune-mediated hepatitis, which might be caused by the undesired expression of antigens in the liver. Therefore, exploring a lymphoid-organ–specific mRNA vaccine could be a promising strategy for developing next-generation mRNA vaccines. Herein, we reported a lymph-node–targeting mRNA vaccine based on lipid nanoparticles named 113-O12B for cancer immunotherapy. The targeted delivery of the mRNA vaccine elicits robust CD8+ T cell responses, exhibiting excellent protective and therapeutic effects on B16F10 melanoma. Notably, 113-O12B can efficiently deliver both a full-length protein and a short-peptide–based, antigens-encoded mRNA, thus providing a universal platform for mRNA vaccines.","The targeted delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to desired organs remains a great challenge for in vivo applications of mRNA technology. For mRNA vaccines, the targeted delivery to the lymph node (LN) is predicted to reduce side effects and increase the immune response. In this study, we explored an endogenously LN-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) without the modification of any active targeting ligands for developing an mRNA cancer vaccine. The LNP named 113-O12B showed increased and specific expression in the LN compared with LNP formulated with ALC-0315, a synthetic lipid used in the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. The targeted delivery of mRNA to the LN increased the CD8+ T cell response to the encoded full-length ovalbumin (OVA) model antigen. As a result, the protective and therapeutic effect of the OVA-encoding mRNA vaccine on the OVA-antigen–bearing B16F10 melanoma model was also improved. Moreover, 113-O12B encapsulated with TRP-2 peptide (TRP2180–188)–encoding mRNA also exhibited excellent tumor inhibition, with the complete response of 40% in the regular B16F10 tumor model when combined with anti–programmed death-1 (PD-1) therapy, revealing broad application of 113-O12B from protein to peptide antigens. All the treated mice showed long-term immune memory, hindering the occurrence of tumor metastatic nodules in the lung in the rechallenging experiments that followed. The enhanced antitumor efficacy of the LN-targeting LNP system shows great potential as a universal platform for the next generation of mRNA vaccines."
84,Nuclear waste from small modular reactors,Environmental sciences,"Small modular reactors (SMRs), proposed as the future of nuclear energy, have purported cost and safety advantages over existing gigawatt-scale light water reactors (LWRs). However, few studies have assessed the implications of SMRs for the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. The low-, intermediate-, and high-level waste stream characterization presented here reveals that SMRs will produce more voluminous and chemically/physically reactive waste than LWRs, which will impact options for the management and disposal of this waste. Although the analysis focuses on only three of dozens of proposed SMR designs, the intrinsically higher neutron leakage associated with SMRs suggests that most designs are inferior to LWRs with respect to the generation, management, and final disposal of key radionuclides in nuclear waste.","Small modular reactors (SMRs; i.e., nuclear reactors that produce <300 MWelec each) have garnered attention because of claims of inherent safety features and reduced cost. However, remarkably few studies have analyzed the management and disposal of their nuclear waste streams. Here, we compare three distinct SMR designs to an 1,100-MWelec pressurized water reactor in terms of the energy-equivalent volume, (radio-)chemistry, decay heat, and fissile isotope composition of (notional) high-, intermediate-, and low-level waste streams. Results reveal that water-, molten salt–, and sodium-cooled SMR designs will increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by factors of 2 to 30. The excess waste volume is attributed to the use of neutron reflectors and/or of chemically reactive fuels and coolants in SMR designs. That said, volume is not the most important evaluation metric; rather, geologic repository performance is driven by the decay heat power and the (radio-)chemistry of spent nuclear fuel, for which SMRs provide no benefit. SMRs will not reduce the generation of geochemically mobile 129I, 99Tc, and 79Se fission products, which are important dose contributors for most repository designs. In addition, SMR spent fuel will contain relatively high concentrations of fissile nuclides, which will demand novel approaches to evaluating criticality during storage and disposal. Since waste stream properties are influenced by neutron leakage, a basic physical process that is enhanced in small reactor cores, SMRs will exacerbate the challenges of nuclear waste management and disposal."
85,Pattern formation along signaling gradients driven by active droplet behavior of cell swarms,Developmental biology,"Gradients of extracellular signals are used to organise the distribution of different cell types within tissues. It is unclear how cells adopt different cell types when they are migrating along gradients. We use lightsheet imaging of Dictyostelium cells to follow cell type choice together with the dynamics of their nutritional signaling gradient. Our data show that cells follow the gradient as a swarm, with cells entering the differentiation programme by being shed, as dense clumps, by the swarm. The shedding of groups and flow patterns of cells within the swarm imply cells behave as a living active droplet, with these fluid-derived behaviours determining the overall spatial organisation of differentiated and undifferentiated cell states in this migratory population.","Gradients of extracellular signals organize cells in tissues. Although there are several models for how gradients can pattern cell behavior, it is not clear how cells react to gradients when the population is undergoing 3D morphogenesis, in which cell–cell and cell–signal interactions are continually changing. Dictyostelium cells follow gradients of their nutritional source to feed and maintain their undifferentiated state. Using lightsheet imaging to simultaneously monitor signaling, single-cell, and population dynamics, we show that the cells migrate toward nutritional gradients in swarms. As swarms advance, they deposit clumps of cells at the rear, triggering differentiation. Clump deposition is explained by a physical model in which cell swarms behave as active droplets: cells proliferate within the swarm, with clump shedding occurring at a critical population size, at which cells at the rear no longer perceive the gradient and are not retained by the emergent surface tension of the swarm. The model predicts vortex motion of the cells within the swarm emerging from the local transfer of propulsion forces, a prediction validated by 3D tracking of single cells. This active fluid behavior reveals a developmental mechanism we term “musical chairs” decision-making, in which the decision to proliferate or differentiate is determined by the position of a cell within the group as it bifurcates."
86,A plant CLE peptide and its fungal mimic promote arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis via CRN-mediated ROS suppression,Plant biology,"Mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi provide plants with mineral nutrients in exchange for carbon. Plants tightly control AM symbiosis and microbial symbionts interfere with host signaling to facilitate symbiosis. Secreted CLE peptides and cognate CLAVATA receptors modulate cell–cell communication during plant development, physiology, and plant–microbe interactions. All so-far described plant CLE peptides are negative regulators of symbiosis. Here, we describe Medicago truncatula CLE16 as a plant signaling peptide that positively regulates AM symbiosis and provide insights into its downstream signaling mechanisms. Additionally, we show that a symbiosis-promoting CLE-like peptide from AM fungi can target the same host signaling pathways as MtCLE16, revealing the signaling mechanisms underpinning the molecular mimicry that allows AM fungi to manipulate hosts for microbial benefit.","CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptides have emerged as key regulators of plant–microbe interactions, including arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Here, we identify Medicago truncatula CLE16 as a positive regulator of AM symbiosis. MtCLE16 is expressed in root cells colonized by AM fungi (AMF) and its overexpression within colonized tissues increases arbuscule abundance by finetuning their growth and lifespan. Functional and transcriptomic analyses reveal that MtCLE16 acts via the M. truncatula pseudokinase CORYNE (MtCRN) and suppresses the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in roots, thereby attenuating immune responses and promoting root colonization by mutualistic AM fungi. Notably, AMF also express MtCLE16-like peptides. We show that the Rhizophagus irregularis MtCLE16-like peptide, RiCLE1, also attenuates ROS and promotes AMF colonization via MtCRN. This finding suggests that RiCLE1 can interfere with the MtCLE16-MtCRN signaling module of host roots to benefit the fungus. Our research uncovers a functional mechanism underpinning cross-kingdom signaling and molecular mimicry in mutualistic plant–microbe interactions."
87,Molecular determinants of sialylated IgG anti-inflammatory activity,Immunology and inflammation,"Terminal sialylation of the single IgG Fc glycan bestows anti-inflammatory activity to subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 but not IgG2 nor IgG4. The anti-inflammatory activity of sialylated IgG1 and IgG3 was dependent on type II Fc γ receptors in vivo. IgG Fc sequence alignment and engineering experiments revealed two shared amino acid residues of IgG1 and IgG3 Fc that, along with sialylation, are required for anti-inflammatory activity in vivo.","IgG antibodies are the basis for many successful therapeutics. A single, N-linked glycan is present on the Fc on all IgGs, and the composition of that glycan exerts marked influence over effector functions of the IgG. We and others have shown terminal sialylation of the Fc glycan confers anti-inflammatory activity to the IgG1 subclass and is thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. However, whether sialylation results in anti-inflammatory activity for other IgG subclasses is unknown. We found that IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2 nor IgG4, suppressed autoantibody-mediated inflammation in vivo when sialylated. This activity was dependent upon human DC-SIGN or its murine ortholog, SIGN-R1. Fc γ receptor-binding profiles for asialylated and sialylated IgG subclasses reinforced these similarities, with IgG1 and IgG3 sharing binding patterns. Amino acid sequence alignments identified two uniquely conserved amino acid residues at positions 234 and 327 of the CH2 domain of all human IgG1 and IgG3 allotypes that were distinct from IgG2 and IgG4. Indeed, molecular modeling of the shared residues in IgG1 and IgG3 revealed a hydrophobic-heavy interchain interaction that was not present in IgG2 nor IgG4. Introduction of those IgG1/3 residues into an IgG4-Fc resulted in anti-inflammatory activity in vivo when sialylated. Conversely, a reciprocal sialylated IgG1 mutant with IgG2/4 residues lacked anti-inflammatory activity. These results define the amino acid requirements of anti-inflammatory sialylated IgG and enable rational amino acid and glycan engineering across all therapeutic IgG subclasses."
88,Muscle peripheral circadian clock drives nocturnal protein degradation via raised Ror/Rev-erb balance and prevents premature sarcopenia,Developmental biology,"Circadian disruption, occurring in shift work, sleep deprivation, or dementia, increases the risk of sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. The cell-intrinsic and extrinsic effects of circadian disruptions, and the mechanistic basis of sarcopenia, remain unclear. We demonstrated that Ror and Rev-erb, two important components of the muscle peripheral clock, are crucial for regulating nocturnal protein clearance via the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy. In animals lacking a functional muscle clock, Ror and Rev-erb imbalances lead to altered circadian muscle growth and reduced muscle function. Notably, muscle clock disruption alone causes premature sarcopenia. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting Ror and Rev-erb to mitigate muscle health issues caused by circadian disruption.","How central and peripheral circadian clocks regulate protein metabolism and affect tissue mass homeostasis has been unclear. Circadian shifts in the balance between anabolism and catabolism control muscle growth rate in young zebrafish independent of behavioral cycles. Here, we show that the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, which mediate muscle protein degradation, are each upregulated at night under the control of the muscle peripheral clock. Perturbation of the muscle transcriptional molecular clock disrupts nocturnal proteolysis, increases muscle growth measured over 12 h, and compromises muscle function. Mechanistically, the shifting circadian balance of Ror and Rev-erb regulates nocturnal UPS, autophagy, and muscle growth through altered TORC1 activity. Although environmental zeitgebers initially mitigate defects, lifelong muscle clock inhibition reduces muscle size and growth rate, accelerating aging-related loss of muscle mass and function. Circadian misalignment such as shift work, sleep deprivation, or dementia may thus unsettle muscle proteostasis, contributing to muscle wasting and sarcopenia."
89,Emotion shapes the diffusion of moralized content in social networks,Psychological and cognitive sciences,"Twitter and other social media platforms are believed to have altered the course of numerous historical events, from the Arab Spring to the US presidential election. Online social networks have become a ubiquitous medium for discussing moral and political ideas. Nevertheless, the field of moral psychology has yet to investigate why some moral and political ideas spread more widely than others. Using a large sample of social media communications concerning polarizing issues in public policy debates (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change), we found that the presence of moral-emotional language in political messages substantially increases their diffusion within (and less so between) ideological group boundaries. These findings offer insights into how moral ideas spread within networks during real political discussion.","Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks."
90,The global biomass of wild mammals,Ecology,"Mammals include some of the best-known species of animals, and are icons of conservation efforts. Despite their status, there is no rigorous estimate available for their overall global biomass. We quantified absolute wild mammalian biomass and its distribution across different taxa and continents. Such data can serve as a holistic benchmark to analyze temporal trends. This quantitative global view of wildlife, when contrasted for example to the mass of humanity and its livestock, can help dispel notions about the seemingly endless ubiquity of wildlife and provide a quantitative argument for the urgency of nature conservation efforts.","Wild mammals are icons of conservation efforts, yet there is no rigorous estimate available for their overall global biomass. Biomass as a metric allows us to compare species with very different body sizes, and can serve as an indicator of wild mammal presence, trends, and impacts, on a global scale. Here, we compiled estimates of the total abundance (i.e., the number of individuals) of several hundred mammal species from the available data, and used these to build a model that infers the total biomass of terrestrial mammal species for which the global abundance is unknown. We present a detailed assessment, arriving at a total wet biomass of ≈20 million tonnes (Mt) for all terrestrial wild mammals (95% CI 13-38 Mt), i.e., ≈3 kg per person on earth. The primary contributors to the biomass of wild land mammals are large herbivores such as the white-tailed deer, wild boar, and African elephant. We find that even-hoofed mammals (artiodactyls, such as deer and boars) represent about half of the combined mass of terrestrial wild mammals. In addition, we estimated the total biomass of wild marine mammals at ≈40 Mt (95% CI 20-80 Mt), with baleen whales comprising more than half of this mass. In order to put wild mammal biomass into perspective, we additionally estimate the biomass of the remaining members of the class Mammalia. The total mammal biomass is overwhelmingly dominated by livestock (≈630 Mt) and humans (≈390 Mt). This work is a provisional census of wild mammal biomass on Earth and can serve as a benchmark for human impacts."
91,Inhaled DNAI1 mRNA therapy for treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia,Medical sciences,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused by loss of ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance, resulting in recurrent respiratory tract infections and bronchiectasis, with no disease-modifying therapies available. We demonstrate that delivery of mRNA, encoding the entire dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1) protein, can rescue ciliary activity in a PCD in vitro cell model. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), aerosolized delivery of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated DNAI1 mRNA at doses sufficient to detect newly translated human DNAI1 protein in cilia was also shown to rescue ciliary function in in vitro PCD models. Thus, these data support further development of the mRNA therapy currently in clinical development for the treatment of PCD.","Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in one of at least 50 different genes that encode proteins involved in the biogenesis, structure, or function of motile cilia. Genetically inherited defects in motile cilia cause PCD, a debilitating respiratory disease for which there is no approved therapy. The dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1) protein is a key structural element of the ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) critical for normal ciliary activity and subsequent clearance of mucus from the conducting airways in humans. Loss-of-function mutations in DNAI1 account for up to 10% of all PCD cases, with functional abnormalities in patients presenting at or near birth and leading to a life-long course of disability, including progressive loss of lung function and bronchiectasis by adulthood. This underscores the significant unmet need for disease-modifying treatments that restore ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance in PCD patients. In this work, we demonstrate that lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated human DNAI1 mRNA can be delivered as an aerosol to primary human bronchial epithelial cell models and to nonhuman primate (NHP) lungs. Additionally, we show that delivery of aerosolized LNP-DNAI1 mRNA to NHPs leads to detectable levels of newly translated human DNAI1 protein, at doses that overlap with exposures in an in vitro cell-based PCD model enabling rescue of ciliary function. Therefore, these data support further development of the inhaled DNAI1 mRNA therapy in clinical studies as a potential disease-modifying treatment for PCD."
92,Enzymatic control of dioxygen binding and functionalization of the flavin cofactor,Biochemistry,"Vitamins are often precursors for the biosynthesis of organic enzyme cofactors, as exemplified by the ubiquitous vitamin B2-derived flavins. Enzymes employ flavins, e.g., to oxygenate organic substrates with the help of covalent flavin–oxygen adducts that serve as oxygenating species. However, details of the preceding reaction of O2 with the reduced flavin cofactor that gives rise to these oxygenating species remain scarce. We have now shown how a flavoenzyme interacts with O2 and controls the formation of an oxygenating species as key to oxidative catalysis. This knowledge will be useful for the bioengineering of flavoenzymes and fine-tuning of their O2 reactivity.","The reactions of enzymes and cofactors with gaseous molecules such as dioxygen (O2) are challenging to study and remain among the most contentious subjects in biochemistry. To date, it is largely enigmatic how enzymes control and fine-tune their reactions with O2, as exemplified by the ubiquitous flavin-dependent enzymes that commonly facilitate redox chemistry such as the oxygenation of organic substrates. Here we employ O2-pressurized X-ray crystallography and quantum mechanical calculations to reveal how the precise positioning of O2 within a flavoenzyme’s active site enables the regiospecific formation of a covalent flavin–oxygen adduct and oxygenating species (i.e., the flavin-N5-oxide) by mimicking a critical transition state. This study unambiguously demonstrates how enzymes may control the O2 functionalization of an organic cofactor as prerequisite for oxidative catalysis. Our work thus illustrates how O2 reactivity can be harnessed in an enzymatic environment and provides crucial knowledge for future rational design of O2-reactive enzymes."
93,"Structural basis for GLP-1 receptor activation by LY3502970, an orally active nonpeptide agonist",Pharmacology,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have become established as a leading class of diabetes medications. However, these peptide-based drugs are administered by subcutaneous injection or, in one case, by a complex oral dosing regimen. We now report the discovery of LY3502970, a potent and selective small-molecule GLP-1R agonist. LY3502970 exhibits preclinical pharmacology equivalent to a marketed injectable GLP-1R agonist and possesses pharmacokinetic properties compatible with oral dosing in humans. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies reveal an ECD-driven receptor binding mode for LY3502970 that provides a favorable pharmacological profile.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are efficacious antidiabetic medications that work by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and improving energy balance. Currently approved GLP-1R agonists are peptide based, and it has proven difficult to obtain small-molecule activators possessing optimal pharmaceutical properties. We report the discovery and mechanism of action of LY3502970 (OWL833), a nonpeptide GLP-1R agonist. LY3502970 is a partial agonist, biased toward G protein activation over β-arrestin recruitment at the GLP-1R. The molecule is highly potent and selective against other class B G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) with a pharmacokinetic profile favorable for oral administration. A high-resolution structure of LY3502970 in complex with active-state GLP-1R revealed a unique binding pocket in the upper helical bundle where the compound is bound by the extracellular domain (ECD), extracellular loop 2, and transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3, and 7. This mechanism creates a distinct receptor conformation that may explain the partial agonism and biased signaling of the compound. Further, interaction between LY3502970 and the primate-specific Trp33 of the ECD informs species selective activity for the molecule. In efficacy studies, oral administration of LY3502970 resulted in glucose lowering in humanized GLP-1R transgenic mice and insulinotropic and hypophagic effects in nonhuman primates, demonstrating an effect size in both models comparable to injectable exenatide. Together, this work determined the molecular basis for the activity of an oral agent being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, offering insights into the activation of class B GPCRs by nonpeptide ligands."
94,On the roles of function and selection in evolving systems,Biophysics and computational biology,"The universe is replete with complex evolving systems, but the existing macroscopic physical laws do not seem to adequately describe these systems. Recognizing that the identification of conceptual equivalencies among disparate phenomena were foundational to developing previous laws of nature, we approach a potential “missing law” by looking for equivalencies among evolving systems. We suggest that all evolving systems—including but not limited to life—are composed of diverse components that can combine into configurational states that are then selected for or against based on function. We then identify the fundamental sources of selection—static persistence, dynamic persistence, and novelty generation—and propose a time-asymmetric law that states that the functional information of a system will increase over time when subjected to selection for function(s).","Physical laws—such as the laws of motion, gravity, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics—codify the general behavior of varied macroscopic natural systems across space and time. We propose that an additional, hitherto-unarticulated law is required to characterize familiar macroscopic phenomena of our complex, evolving universe. An important feature of the classical laws of physics is the conceptual equivalence of specific characteristics shared by an extensive, seemingly diverse body of natural phenomena. Identifying potential equivalencies among disparate phenomena—for example, falling apples and orbiting moons or hot objects and compressed springs—has been instrumental in advancing the scientific understanding of our world through the articulation of laws of nature. A pervasive wonder of the natural world is the evolution of varied systems, including stars, minerals, atmospheres, and life. These evolving systems appear to be conceptually equivalent in that they display three notable attributes: 1) They form from numerous components that have the potential to adopt combinatorially vast numbers of different configurations; 2) processes exist that generate numerous different configurations; and 3) configurations are preferentially selected based on function. We identify universal concepts of selection—static persistence, dynamic persistence, and novelty generation—that underpin function and drive systems to evolve through the exchange of information between the environment and the system. Accordingly, we propose a “law of increasing functional information”: The functional information of a system will increase (i.e., the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system undergo selection for one or more functions."
95,Serotonin modulates melatonin synthesis as an autocrine neurotransmitter in the pineal gland,Neuroscience,"The pineal gland secretes melatonin at night mainly driven by adrenergic sympathetic inputs. Many other neurotransmitters are found in the pineal gland, suggesting potential fine modulation of melatonin release. Serotonin as a precursor of melatonin synthesis is known to be significantly released by pinealocytes and its receptor also is expressed in pinealocytes. By identifying the release mechanism, cell signaling in the pinealocytes, and its effect on norepinephrine-induced melatonin secretion, our study defines serotonin as an autocrine neurotransmitter in the pineal gland and suggests possible modulatory targets for melatonin secretion.","The pineal gland secretes melatonin principally at night. Regulated by norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve terminals, adrenergic receptors on pinealocytes activate aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase that converts 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) to N-acetylserotonin, the precursor of melatonin. Previous studies from our group and others reveal significant constitutive secretion of 5-HT from pinealocytes. Here, using mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that the 5-HT is secreted primarily via a decynium-22–sensitive equilibrative plasma membrane monoamine transporter instead of by typical exocytotic quantal secretion. Activation of the endogenous 5-HT receptors on pinealocytes evoked an intracellular Ca2+ rise that was blocked by RS-102221, an antagonist of 5-HT2C receptors. Applied 5-HT did not evoke melatonin secretion by itself, but it did potentiate melatonin secretion evoked by submaximal norepinephrine. In addition, RS-102221 reduced the norepinephrine-induced melatonin secretion in strips of pineal gland, even when no exogenous 5-HT was added, suggesting that the 5-HT that is constitutively released from pinealocytes accumulates enough in the tissue to act as an autocrine feedback signal sensitizing melatonin release."
96,Evaluating large language models in theory of mind tasks,Computer sciences,"Humans automatically and effortlessly track others’ unobservable mental states, such as their knowledge, intentions, beliefs, and desires. This ability—typically called “theory of mind” (ToM)—is fundamental to human social interactions, communication, empathy, consciousness, moral judgment, and religious beliefs. Our results show that recent large language models (LLMs) can solve false-belief tasks, typically used to evaluate ToM in humans. Regardless of how we interpret these outcomes, they signify the advent of more powerful and socially skilled AI—with profound positive and negative implications.","Eleven large language models (LLMs) were assessed using 40 bespoke false-belief tasks, considered a gold standard in testing theory of mind (ToM) in humans. Each task included a false-belief scenario, three closely matched true-belief control scenarios, and the reversed versions of all four. An LLM had to solve all eight scenarios to solve a single task. Older models solved no tasks; Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3-davinci-003 (from November 2022) and ChatGPT-3.5-turbo (from March 2023) solved 20% of the tasks; ChatGPT-4 (from June 2023) solved 75% of the tasks, matching the performance of 6-y-old children observed in past studies. We explore the potential interpretation of these results, including the intriguing possibility that ToM-like ability, previously considered unique to humans, may have emerged as an unintended by-product of LLMs’ improving language skills. Regardless of how we interpret these outcomes, they signify the advent of more powerful and socially skilled AI—with profound positive and negative implications."
97,"All human social groups are human, but some are more human than others: A comprehensive investigation of the implicit association of “Human” to US racial/ethnic groups",Psychological and cognitive sciences,"All humans belong to the species Homo sapiens. Yet, throughout history, humans have breathed life into the Orwellian adage that “All [humans] are equal, but some [humans] are more equal than others.” Here, participants staunchly rejected this adage, with the overwhelming majority of over 61,000 participants reporting that all humans are equally human. However, across 13 experiments, US White participants (and White participants abroad) showed robust evidence of an implicit Human=Own Group association. Conversely, Black, Latinx, and Asian participants in the United States did not demonstrate this bias. These results highlight the tendency among socially dominant groups to reserve the quality Human for their own kind, producing, even in the 21st century, the age-old error of pseudospeciation.","All human groups are equally human, but are they automatically represented as such? Harnessing data from 61,377 participants across 13 experiments (six primary and seven supplemental), a sharp dissociation between implicit and explicit measures emerged. Despite explicitly affirming the equal humanity of all racial/ethnic groups, White participants consistently associated Human (relative to Animal) more with White than Black, Hispanic, and Asian groups on Implicit Association Tests (IATs; experiments 1–4). This effect emerged across diverse representations of Animal that varied in valence (pets, farm animals, wild animals, and vermin; experiments 1–2). Non-White participants showed no such Human=Own Group bias (e.g., Black participants on a White–Black/Human–Animal IAT). However, when the test included two outgroups (e.g., Asian participants on a White–Black/Human–Animal IAT), non-White participants displayed Human=White associations. The overall effect was largely invariant across demographic variations in age, religion, and education but did vary by political ideology and gender, with self-identified conservatives and men displaying stronger Human=White associations (experiment 3). Using a variance decomposition method, experiment 4 showed that the Human=White effect cannot be attributed to valence alone; the semantic meaning of Human and Animal accounted for a unique proportion of variance. Similarly, the effect persisted even when Human was contrasted with positive attributes (e.g., God, Gods, and Dessert; experiment 5a). Experiments 5a-b clarified the primacy of Human=White rather than Animal=Black associations. Together, these experiments document a factually erroneous but robust Human=Own Group implicit stereotype among US White participants (and globally), with suggestive evidence of its presence in other socially dominant groups."
98,Invasive predators and global biodiversity loss,Ecology,"Invasive mammalian predators are arguably the most damaging group of alien animal species for global biodiversity. Thirty species of invasive predator are implicated in the extinction or endangerment of 738 vertebrate species—collectively contributing to 58% of all bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions. Cats, rodents, dogs, and pigs have the most pervasive impacts, and endemic island faunas are most vulnerable to invasive predators. That most impacted species are insular indicates that management of invasive predators on islands should be a global conservation priority. Understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive mammalian predators is essential for reducing the rate of global biodiversity loss.","Invasive species threaten biodiversity globally, and invasive mammalian predators are particularly damaging, having contributed to considerable species decline and extinction. We provide a global metaanalysis of these impacts and reveal their full extent. Invasive predators are implicated in 87 bird, 45 mammal, and 10 reptile species extinctions—58% of these groups’ contemporary extinctions worldwide. These figures are likely underestimated because 23 critically endangered species that we assessed are classed as “possibly extinct.” Invasive mammalian predators endanger a further 596 species at risk of extinction, with cats, rodents, dogs, and pigs threatening the most species overall. Species most at risk from predators have high evolutionary distinctiveness and inhabit insular environments. Invasive mammalian predators are therefore important drivers of irreversible loss of phylogenetic diversity worldwide. That most impacted species are insular indicates that management of invasive predators on islands should be a global conservation priority. Understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive mammalian predators is essential for reducing the rate of global biodiversity loss."
99,"Asteroid impact, not volcanism, caused the end-Cretaceous dinosaur extinction","Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences","We present a quantitative test of end-Cretaceous extinction scenarios and how these would have affected dinosaur habitats. Combining climate and ecological modeling tools, we demonstrate a substantial detrimental effect on dinosaur habitats caused by an impact winter scenario triggered by the Chicxulub asteroid. We were not able to obtain such an extinction state with several modeling scenarios of Deccan volcanism. We further show that the concomitant prolonged eruption of the Deccan traps might have acted as an ameliorating agent, buffering the negative effects on climate and global ecosystems that the asteroid impact produced at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary.","The Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction, 66 Ma, included the demise of non-avian dinosaurs. Intense debate has focused on the relative roles of Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub asteroid impact as kill mechanisms for this event. Here, we combine fossil-occurrence data with paleoclimate and habitat suitability models to evaluate dinosaur habitability in the wake of various asteroid impact and Deccan volcanism scenarios. Asteroid impact models generate a prolonged cold winter that suppresses potential global dinosaur habitats. Conversely, long-term forcing from Deccan volcanism (carbon dioxide [CO2]-induced warming) leads to increased habitat suitability. Short-term (aerosol cooling) volcanism still allows equatorial habitability. These results support the asteroid impact as the main driver of the non-avian dinosaur extinction. By contrast, induced warming from volcanism mitigated the most extreme effects of asteroid impact, potentially reducing the extinction severity."
100,Data-driven discovery of coordinates and governing equations,Applied Mathematics,"Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science.","The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing."
101,Metals from spacecraft reentry in stratospheric aerosol particles,"Earth, Atmospheric, And Planetary Sciences","Measurements show that about 10% of the aerosol particles in the stratosphere contain aluminum and other metals that originated from the “burn-up” of satellites and rocket stages during reentry. Although direct health or environmental impacts at ground level are unlikely, these measurements have broad implications for the stratosphere and higher altitudes. With many more launches planned in the coming decades, metals from spacecraft reentry could induce changes in the stratospheric aerosol layer.","Large increases in the number of low earth orbit satellites are projected in the coming decades [L. Schulz, K.-H. Glassmeier, Adv. Space Res. 67, 1002–1025 (2021)] with perhaps 50,000 additional satellites in orbit by 2030 [GAO, Large constellations of satellites: Mitigating environmental and other effects (2022)]. When spent rocket bodies and defunct satellites reenter the atmosphere, they produce metal vapors that condense into aerosol particles that descend into the stratosphere. So far, models of spacecraft reentry have focused on understanding the hazard presented by objects that survive to the surface rather than on the fate of the metals that vaporize. Here, we show that metals that vaporized during spacecraft reentries can be clearly measured in stratospheric sulfuric acid particles. Over 20 elements from reentry were detected and were present in ratios consistent with alloys used in spacecraft. The mass of lithium, aluminum, copper, and lead from the reentry of spacecraft was found to exceed the cosmic dust influx of those metals. About 10% of stratospheric sulfuric acid particles larger than 120 nm in diameter contain aluminum and other elements from spacecraft reentry. Planned increases in the number of low earth orbit satellites within the next few decades could cause up to half of stratospheric sulfuric acid particles to contain metals from reentry. The influence of this level of metallic content on the properties of stratospheric aerosol is unknown."
102,Unraveling structural transitions and kinetics along the fold-switching pathway of the RfaH C-terminal domain using exchange-based NMR,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"A growing number of protein domains have been shown to undergo fold switching upon interaction with a partner, yet the mechanism remains unknown. One example is the transcriptional regulator RfaH whose C-terminal domain switches from an α-helical hairpin packed against the N-terminal domain to a β-roll when displaced upon RNA polymerase binding. Here, using NMR, we explore slow (subsecond) and fast (submillisecond to millisecond) structural transitions sampled by the isolated C-terminal domain of RfaH. In addition to the predominant, semistable β-roll structure, four distinct, sparsely populated, transient states are identified, three of which represent intermediates along the fold-switching pathway. The first intermediate (populated at ~25%), while largely unfolded, is characterized by transient helical and β-hairpin elements packed against one another.","The bacterial transcriptional regulator RfaH comprises structurally and functionally distinct N- (NTD) and C- (CTD) terminal domains. The latter switches from a helical hairpin packed against the NTD to a five-stranded β-roll upon displacement by RNA polymerase binding. Here, we use exchange-based NMR to probe fold-switching intermediates sampled by the isolated CTD. In addition to the predominant (~76 to 77%), semistable β-roll conformation (state A), we identify four structurally and kinetically distinct states: A′, B, B′, and B″. State B is NMR observable with an occupancy of ~23%, exchanges slowly (τex ~ 300 ms) with the major A species, and comprises a largely unfolded ensemble with transient occupancy of helical (α5*) and β-hairpin (β1*/β2*) elements. Backbone chemical shift-based structure predictions using the program CS-ROSETTA suggest that the two transient structural elements within the B state may interact with one another to form a semicompact structure. A′ (~0.35%) is an off-pathway state that exchanges rapidly (τex ~ 1 ms) with state A and likely entails a minor localized conformational change in the β1/β2 loop. State B′ (~0.3%) exchanges rapidly (τex ~ 1.2 ms) with state B and exhibits downfield 15N backbone shifts (relative to B) in the α5* region indicative of reduced helicity. Finally state B″ (~0.05%) exchanges rapidly (τex ~ 0.8 to 1 ms) with either B′ (linear model) or B (branched model), displays significant differences in absolute 15N chemical shift from states B and B′, and likely represents a further intermediate with increased helicity along the fold-switching pathway."
103,Augmenting the availability of historical GDP per capita estimates through machine learning,Economic Sciences,"The scarcity of historical GDP per capita data limits our ability to explore questions of long-term economic development. Here, we introduce a machine learning method using detailed data on famous biographies to estimate the historical GDP per capita of hundreds of regions in Europe and North America. Our model generates accurate out-of-sample estimates (R2 = 90%) that quadruple the availability of historical GDP per capita data and correlate positively with proxies of economic output such as urbanization, body height, well-being, and church building activity. We use these estimates to reproduce the reversal of fortunes experienced by southern and northern Europe and the historical role played by Atlantic ports. These findings show that machine learning can effectively augment the historical availability of economic data.","Can we use data on the biographies of historical figures to estimate the GDP per capita of countries and regions? Here, we introduce a machine learning method to estimate the GDP per capita of dozens of countries and hundreds of regions in Europe and North America for the past seven centuries starting from data on the places of birth, death, and occupations of hundreds of thousands of historical figures. We build an elastic net regression model to perform feature selection and generate out-of-sample estimates that explain 90% of the variance in known historical income levels. We use this model to generate GDP per capita estimates for countries, regions, and time periods for which these data are not available and externally validate our estimates by comparing them with four proxies of economic output: urbanization rates in the past 500 y, body height in the 18th century, well-being in 1850, and church building activity in the 14th and 15th century. Additionally, we show our estimates reproduce the well-known reversal of fortune between southwestern and northwestern Europe between 1300 and 1800 and find this is largely driven by countries and regions engaged in Atlantic trade. These findings validate the use of fine-grained biographical data as a method to augment historical GDP per capita estimates. We publish our estimates with CI together with all collected source data in a comprehensive dataset."
104,Mushrooms use convectively created airflows to disperse their spores,Applied Physical Sciences,"Mushroom spore dispersal is usually described as a two-phase process: active ejection of spores clear of the gill surface by surface tension catapults, followed by a passive phase in which the spores are carried by whatever winds are present beneath the mushroom cap. Here, we show that control extends into the second phase of dispersal: water vapor loss creates slow airflows that carry spores out from under the mushroom cap and potentially tens of centimeters into the air. In addition to clarifying why mushrooms have such high water needs, and providing a mechanism by which spore dispersal can occur even in a low-wind environment, our work shows that the physics of apparently passive dispersal may be under organismal control.",Thousands of basidiomycete fungal species rely on mushroom spores to spread across landscapes. It has long been thought that spores depend on favorable winds for dispersal—that active control of spore dispersal by the parent fungus is limited to an impulse delivered to the spores to carry them clear of the gill surface. Here we show that evaporative cooling of the air surrounding the pileus creates convective airflows capable of carrying spores at speeds of centimeters per second. Convective cells can transport spores from gaps that may be only 1 cm high and lift spores 10 cm or more into the air. This work reveals how mushrooms tolerate and even benefit from crowding and explains their high water needs.
105,Synthesis of evidence yields high social cost of carbon due to structural model variation and uncertainties,Economic Sciences,"Estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC)—the cost of one additional ton of CO2 emitted—is crucial for the analysis of climate change policies. Despite numerous recent studies investigating how fundamental aspects of model structure affect SCC evaluation, findings are scattered, making the relative importance of different modeling elements hard to establish. This paper synthesizes results from the published literature over the last 20 y, revealing a wide range of SCC estimates. However, survey evidence reveals experts believe estimates in the literature are too low due to a range of limitations in published values. Reweighting the literature to partly address these omissions more than doubles the SCC to $283.","Estimating the cost to society from a ton of CO2—termed the social cost of carbon (SCC)—requires connecting a model of the climate system with a representation of the economic and social effects of changes in climate, and the aggregation of diverse, uncertain impacts across both time and space. A growing literature has examined the effect of fundamental structural elements of the models supporting SCC calculations. This work has accumulated in a piecemeal fashion, leaving their relative importance unclear. Here, we perform a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the SCC, combining 1,823 estimates of the SCC from 147 studies with a survey of authors of these studies. The distribution of published 2020 SCC values is wide and substantially right-skewed, showing evidence of a heavy right tail (truncated mean of $132). ANOVA reveals important roles for the inclusion of persistent damages, the representation of the Earth system, and distributional weighting. However, our survey reveals that experts believe the literature underestimates the SCC due to an undersampling of model structures, incomplete characterization of damages, and high discount rates. To address this imbalance, we train a random forest model on variation in the literature and use it to generate a synthetic SCC distribution that more closely matches expert assessments of appropriate model structure and discounting. This synthetic distribution has a mean of $283 per ton CO2 for a 2020 pulse year (5% to 95% range: $32 to $874), higher than most official government estimates, including a 2023 update from the U.S. EPA."
106,A WRKY transcription factor confers broad-spectrum resistance to biotic stresses and yield stability in rice,Agricultural Sciences,"Few genes have been identified that confer broad-spectrum resistance against both crop insects and diseases. Furthermore, balancing energy allocation between growth and defense to optimize crop yield remains a major challenge. Here, we found that knocking out OsWRKY36 derepresses the transcription of OsPALs, leading to increased biosynthesis of lignin and thickening of the sclerenchyma in rice leaf sheaths, thereby conferring broad-spectrum resistance. Additionally, knocking out OsWRKY36 also derepresses the transcription of IPA1 and MOC2, resulting in increased spikelets per panicle and tiller number, contributing to stable yield maintenance. Our findings not only provide insights into balancing broad-spectrum resistance and development but also present a promising strategy for molecular breeding in rice to achieve a balance between resistance and yield.","Plants are subject to attack by diverse pests and pathogens. Few genes conferring broad-spectrum resistance to both insects and pathogens have been identified. Because of the growth–defense tradeoff, it is often challenging to balance biotic stress resistance and yield for crops. Here, we report that OsWRKY36 suppresses the resistance to insects and pathogens via transcriptional repression of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyases (PALs), a key enzyme in phenylpropanoid pathway in rice. Knocking out OsWRKY36 causes elevated lignin biosynthesis and increased sclerenchyma thickness of leaf sheath, leading to enhanced resistance to multiple pests and pathogens. Additionally, loss of OsWRKY36 also derepresses the transcription of Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) and MONOCULM2 (MOC2), resulting in increased spikelet number per panicle and tiller number. These findings provide mechanistic insights into biotic stress tolerance in rice and offer a promising strategy to breed rice cultivars with broad-spectrum resistance to insects and pathogens while maintaining stable yield."
107,Autocatalytic symmetry breaking and chiral amplification in a feedback network combining amino acid synthesis and ligation,Chemistry,"Some molecules and macroscopic objects may exist in two mirror-image forms, like our right and left hands. The amino acids and sugars that make up the building blocks of biological polymers are homochiral, but synthesis in the laboratory produces equal concentrations of both forms. How did biological homochirality come about? One of the earliest theoretical reports invoked asymmetric autocatalysis with chiral amplification as a route to homochirality, a model that has been realized experimentally in only a single reaction without prebiotic relevance. We demonstrate theoretically how two recently reported experimental examples of chiral amplification may be combined to provide a prebiotically plausible autocatalytic network leading to symmetry breaking and biological homochirality in amino acids and peptides.","A kinetic model coupling prebiotically plausible synthesis of enantioenriched proteinogenic amino acids with catalytic peptide ligation leads to an autocatalytic network that may exhibit symmetry breaking and chiral amplification, providing a feasible route to the emergence of biological homochirality. We show that symmetry breaking leading to chiral amplification can occur in two ways: a constructive mechanism in which dimers catalyze the synthesis of monomers of the same enantiomer, and a destructive mechanism in which dimers catalyze the breakdown of monomers of the opposite enantiomer."
108,Cardiac signals inform auditory regularity processing in the absence of consciousness,Neuroscience,"Elucidating how internal signals from the body influence the processing of external information from the environment is key to our understanding of perception and cognition in health and pathological conditions. Here, by testing comatose patients, we identify a mechanism by which the unconscious human brain uses ongoing inputs from the heart to track sequences of auditory stimuli. The interplay of heart signals and sounds led to changes in brain and heart activity that helped predict coma recovery. We suggest that the integration of internal and external signals extends to unconscious states and may represent an essential and computationally efficient mechanism for the detection of changes and threats in the external world.","In healthy awake individuals, the neural processing of bodily signals is not only essential for survival but can also influence perception and compete with external stimulus processing. Yet, the mechanism underlying this bidirectional processing of bodily and external stimuli, as well as its persistence or modulation in unconscious states, remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac activity on auditory regularity processing in coma. We recorded continuous electroencephalography and electrocardiography in 48 comatose patients on the first day after cardiac arrest during a closed-loop auditory paradigm. We tested whether sounds presented in synchrony with the ongoing heartbeat and sounds presented with fixed, isochronous intervals, would facilitate auditory processing, compared to an asynchronous sequence with variable heartbeat-to-sound and sound-to-sound intervals and a baseline without auditory stimulation. To assess sound prediction based on sequence regularity, we introduced sound omissions within the sequences, violating expected auditory patterns. In coma survivors only, the neural omission response differed in the synchronous against both control conditions. These results were corroborated by a multivariate decoding analysis of the single-trial neural responses to the synchronous omissions and baseline wherein survivors exhibited a higher degree of cardio-audio regularity encoding compared to nonsurvivors. Furthermore, omissions within the synchronous sequence elicited a heart rate deceleration exclusively in coma survivors, which was predictive of patient outcome. We show that the unconscious human brain infers on the temporal relationship across cardiac and auditory inputs and that the neural and cardiac correlates of cardio-audio regularity encoding are predictive of patient outcome."
109,Universal healthcare as pandemic preparedness: The lives and costs that could have been saved during the COVID-19 pandemic,Economic Sciences,"The fragmented and inefficient healthcare system in the United States leads to many preventable deaths and unnecessary costs every year. Universal healthcare could have alleviated the mortality caused by a confluence of negative COVID-related factors. Incorporating the demography of the uninsured with age-specific COVID-19 and nonpandemic mortality, we estimated that a single-payer universal healthcare system would have saved 212,000 lives in 2020 alone. We also calculated that US$105.6 billion of medical expenses associated with COVID-19 hospitalization could have been averted by a Medicare for All system.","The fragmented and inefficient healthcare system in the United States leads to many preventable deaths and unnecessary costs every year. During a pandemic, the lives saved and economic benefits of a single-payer universal healthcare system relative to the status quo would be even greater. For Americans who are uninsured and underinsured, financial barriers to COVID-19 care delayed diagnosis and exacerbated transmission. Concurrently, deaths beyond COVID-19 accrued from the background rate of uninsurance. Universal healthcare would alleviate the mortality caused by the confluence of these factors. To evaluate the repercussions of incomplete insurance coverage in 2020, we calculated the elevated mortality attributable to the loss of employer-sponsored insurance and to background rates of uninsurance, summing with the increased COVID-19 mortality due to low insurance coverage. Incorporating the demography of the uninsured with age-specific COVID-19 and nonpandemic mortality, we estimated that a single-payer universal healthcare system would have saved about 212,000 lives in 2020 alone. We also calculated that US$105.6 billion of medical expenses associated with COVID-19 hospitalization could have been averted by a single-payer universal healthcare system over the course of the pandemic. These economic benefits are in addition to US$438 billion expected to be saved by single-payer universal healthcare during a nonpandemic year."
110,Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"It remains unclear who is susceptible to misinformation. We synthesized 31 studies to uncover how key demographic and psychological factors impact misinformation susceptibility. We distinguished between the ability to differentiate true from false news (discrimination ability) and response bias: the tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). We found that older adults, Democrats (compared to Republicans), and those with higher analytical thinking skills show greater discrimination ability. Ideological congruency (alignment of participants’ ideology with news), motivated reflection (higher analytical thinking skills being associated with a greater congruency effect), and self-reported familiarity with news were linked with a true-news bias. Our results provide insights for better theory building and for designing targeted interventions.","Nearly five billion people use and receive news through social media and there is widespread concern about the negative consequences of misinformation on social media (e.g., election interference, vaccine hesitancy). Despite a burgeoning body of research on misinformation, it remains largely unclear who is susceptible to misinformation and why. To address this, we conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 US-based participants across 31 experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from response bias, that is, the tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). Across all studies, participants were well above-chance accurate for both true (68.51%) and false (67.24%) news headlines. We find that older age, higher analytical thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Additionally, older age and higher analytical thinking skills are associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency (alignment of participants’ ideology with news), motivated reflection (higher analytical thinking skills being associated with a greater congruency effect), and self-reported familiarity with news are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety). We also find that experiments on MTurk show higher discrimination ability than those on Lucid. Displaying sources alongside news headlines is associated with improved discrimination ability, with Republicans benefiting more from source display. Our results provide critical insights that can help inform the design of targeted interventions."
111,Requirements and limits for life in the context of exoplanets,Astronomy,"Our understanding of life on exoplanets and exomoons must be based on what we know about life on Earth. Liquid water is the common ecological requirement for Earth life. Temperature on an exoplanet is the first parameter to consider both because of its influence on liquid water and because it can be directly estimated from orbital and climate models of exoplanetary systems. Life needs some water, but deserts show that even a little can be enough. Only a small amount of light from the central star is required to provide for photosynthesis. Some nitrogen must be present for life and the presence of oxygen would be a good indicator of photosynthesis and possibly complex life.","The requirements for life on Earth, its elemental composition, and its environmental limits provide a way to assess the habitability of exoplanets. Temperature is key both because of its influence on liquid water and because it can be directly estimated from orbital and climate models of exoplanetary systems. Life can grow and reproduce at temperatures as low as −15 °C, and as high as 122 °C. Studies of life in extreme deserts show that on a dry world, even a small amount of rain, fog, snow, and even atmospheric humidity can be adequate for photosynthetic production producing a small but detectable microbial community. Life is able to use light at levels less than 10−5 of the solar flux at Earth. UV or ionizing radiation can be tolerated by many microorganisms at very high levels and is unlikely to be life limiting on an exoplanet. Biologically available nitrogen may limit habitability. Levels of O2 over a few percent on an exoplanet would be consistent with the presence of multicellular organisms and high levels of O2 on Earth-like worlds indicate oxygenic photosynthesis. Other factors such as pH and salinity are likely to vary and not limit life over an entire planet or moon."
112,US grass-fed beef is as carbon intensive as industrial beef and ≈10-fold more intensive than common protein-dense alternatives,Applied Biological Sciences,"Beef is more resource intensive per gram of edible protein than most other food items. Yet, grass-fed beef is sometimes promoted as environmentally desirable based on the expectation that cattle grazing may enhance soil carbon sequestration, thus offsetting production emissions. We quantitatively examine this view by integrating empirical observations with a beef herd model that uses standard animal science equations. We find that even under optimistic rangeland sequestration, grass-fed beef is not less carbon intensive than industrial beef and 3 to 40 times as carbon intensive as most plant and animal alternatives.","The high resource intensity of industrial beef in high-income economies has prompted growing interest in alternative, potentially lower environmental impact beef production pathways. Of those, grass feeding is promoted by some as one such alternative, but rigorous quantification of this claim is required. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap, we integrate empirical evidence with a model based on authoritative equations governing beef cattle performance to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of producing grass-fed beef. Because geographical specificity and dependence on agricultural intensity are key, we model widely varied herds, from extensive operations on semiarid, marginal rangelands to partially industrial, intensive ones in lusher, more accommodating settings. We find that emissions per kg protein of even the most efficient grass-fed beef are 10 to 25% higher than those of industrial US beef and 3- to over 40-fold higher than a wide range of plant and animal alternatives. Soil sequestration enhancement by rangeland grazing reduces these emissions from 280–390 to 180–290 kg CO2eq (kg protein)−1, still somewhat above industrial beef’s 180 to 220 kg CO2eq (kg protein)−1, and well above nonbeef alternatives’ 10 to 70 kg CO2eq (kg protein)−1. These differences prove robust across a broad set of combinations of grass-fed beef operation types, management practices, and ration qualities. Consequently, even with maximal credit for putative sequestration enhancement, grass-fed beef is still no less carbon intensive than industrial beef, and severalfold more intensive than nonbeef alternatives."
113,Structure and mutagenic analysis of the lipid II flippase MurJ from Escherichia coli,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"A peptidoglycan cell wall provides bacteria with protection from environmental stresses, and interfering with assembly of the cell wall is among the most effective strategies for antibiotic development. To build a cell wall, bacteria first synthesize lipid II on the inner leaflet of their membrane and then flip it across to the outer leaflet, where it is used to make peptidoglycan. Here, we report the structure of the lipid II flippase MurJ from Escherichia coli, and we use high-throughput mutagenesis to identify functionally important regions of the protein. Together with evolutionary covariation analysis, these data show that MurJ must exist in at least two discrete conformational states, providing a framework for understanding lipid II flipping.","The peptidoglycan cell wall provides an essential protective barrier in almost all bacteria, defining cellular morphology and conferring resistance to osmotic stress and other environmental hazards. The precursor to peptidoglycan, lipid II, is assembled on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, peptidoglycan polymerization occurs on the outer face of the plasma membrane, and lipid II must be flipped across the membrane by the MurJ protein before its use in peptidoglycan synthesis. Due to its central role in cell wall assembly, MurJ is of fundamental importance in microbial cell biology and is a prime target for novel antibiotic development. However, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of MurJ function, and structural data for MurJ are available only from the extremophile Thermosipho africanus. Here, we report the crystal structure of substrate-free MurJ from the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, revealing an inward-open conformation. Taking advantage of the genetic tractability of E. coli, we performed high-throughput mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing to assess mutational tolerance at every amino acid in the protein, providing a detailed functional and structural map for the enzyme and identifying sites for inhibitor development. Lastly, through the use of sequence coevolution analysis, we identify functionally important interactions in the outward-open state of the protein, supporting a rocker-switch model for lipid II transport."
114,Spatial transcriptome profiling by MERFISH reveals subcellular RNA compartmentalization and cell cycle-dependent gene expression,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"The spatial organization of RNAs within cells and spatial patterning of cells within tissues play crucial roles in many biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) can achieve near-genome-wide, spatially resolved RNA profiling of individual cells with high accuracy and high detection efficiency. Using this approach, we identified RNA species enriched in different subcellular compartments, observed transcriptionally distinct cell states corresponding to different cell-cycle phases, and revealed spatial patterning of transcriptionally distinct cells. Spatially resolved transcriptome quantification within cells further enabled RNA velocity and pseudotime analysis, which revealed numerous genes with cell cycle-dependent expression. We anticipate that spatially resolved transcriptome analysis will advance our understanding of the interplay between gene regulation and spatial context in biological systems.","The expression profiles and spatial distributions of RNAs regulate many cellular functions. Image-based transcriptomic approaches provide powerful means to measure both expression and spatial information of RNAs in individual cells within their native environment. Among these approaches, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) has achieved spatially resolved RNA quantification at transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing single-molecule FISH measurements. Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80% detection efficiency and ∼4% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved, genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and organization in tissues."
115,Resolving content moderation dilemmas between free speech and harmful misinformation,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Content moderation of online speech is a moral minefield, especially when two key values come into conflict: upholding freedom of expression and preventing harm caused by misinformation. Currently, these decisions are made without any knowledge of how people would approach them. In our study, we systematically varied factors that could influence moral judgments and found that despite significant differences along political lines, most US citizens preferred quashing harmful misinformation over protecting free speech. Furthermore, people were more likely to remove posts and suspend accounts if the consequences of the misinformation were severe or if it was a repeated offense. Our results can inform the design of transparent, consistent rules for content moderation that the general public accepts as legitimate.","In online content moderation, two key values may come into conflict: protecting freedom of expression and preventing harm. Robust rules based in part on how citizens think about these moral dilemmas are necessary to deal with this conflict in a principled way, yet little is known about people’s judgments and preferences around content moderation. We examined such moral dilemmas in a conjoint survey experiment where US respondents (N = 2, 564) indicated whether they would remove problematic social media posts on election denial, antivaccination, Holocaust denial, and climate change denial and whether they would take punitive action against the accounts. Respondents were shown key information about the user and their post as well as the consequences of the misinformation. The majority preferred quashing harmful misinformation over protecting free speech. Respondents were more reluctant to suspend accounts than to remove posts and more likely to do either if the harmful consequences of the misinformation were severe or if sharing it was a repeated offense. Features related to the account itself (the person behind the account, their partisanship, and number of followers) had little to no effect on respondents’ decisions. Content moderation of harmful misinformation was a partisan issue: Across all four scenarios, Republicans were consistently less willing than Democrats or independents to remove posts or penalize the accounts that posted them. Our results can inform the design of transparent rules for content moderation of harmful misinformation."
116,Meta-analytic relations between personality and cognitive ability,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Personality and cognitive ability are consequential domains of human individuality. More than 100 y of research has examined their connections, and yet most ability–personality relations remain unknown. We quantitatively synthesized 1,325 studies including millions of individuals from more than 50 countries to identify novel, considerable ties between personality traits and cognitive abilities. Neuroticism facets (e.g., suspiciousness, depression) were negatively related to most cognitive abilities including non-invested (e.g., fluid reasoning) and invested abilities (e.g., knowledge). Extraversion’s activity facet had sizable, positive relations with several non-invested (e.g., retrieval fluency and processing abilities) and invested abilities. Conscientiousness’ industriousness and agreeableness’ compassion aspects positively related to most invested abilities. Previous focus on high-level relations obscured understanding of individual differences and their applications.","Cognitive ability and personality are fundamental domains of human psychology. Despite a century of vast research, most ability–personality relations remain unestablished. Using contemporary hierarchical personality and cognitive abilities frameworks, we meta-analyze unexamined links between personality traits and cognitive abilities and offer large-scale evidence of their relations. This research quantitatively summarizes 60,690 relations between 79 personality and 97 cognitive ability constructs in 3,543 meta-analyses based on data from millions of individuals. Sets of novel relations are illuminated by distinguishing hierarchical personality and ability constructs (e.g., factors, aspects, facets). The links between personality traits and cognitive abilities are not limited to openness and its components. Some aspects and facets of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are also considerably related to primary as well as specific abilities. Overall, the results provide an encyclopedic quantification of what is currently known about personality–ability relations, identify previously unrecognized trait pairings, and reveal knowledge gaps. The meta-analytic findings are visualized in an interactive webtool. The database of coded studies and relations is offered to the scientific community to further advance research, understanding, and applications."
117,Structural insights into the activation of the human prostaglandin E2 receptor EP1 subtype by prostaglandin E2,Biochemistry,"EP1 is involved in various pathological processes but has been the most challenging EP receptor subtype to study structurally due to its inherent instability. This study presents the cryo-EM structure of the EP1 receptor in complex with PGE2 and Gq protein, completing the structural framework for the EP receptor family and filling a critical gap in our understanding of prostaglandin signaling. The unique binding and activation features of EP1 reveal distinct receptor–ligand interactions, providing valuable insights for the rational design of EP1-targeted therapeutics.","Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) mediates diverse physiological processes through four G protein–coupled receptor subtypes (EP1–EP4). While structures of EP2, EP3, and EP4 have been determined, the structural basis for PGE2 recognition and activation of the EP1 receptor subtype has remained elusive due to its inherent instability. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human EP1 receptor in complex with PGE2 and heterotrimeric Gq protein at 2.55 Å resolution, completing the structural characterization of the EP receptor family. Our structure reveals a unique binding mode of PGE2 within EP1, involving key interactions with residues in the orthosteric pocket. Notably, we observe a less pronounced outward displacement of transmembrane helix 6 compared to other EP receptor subtypes, suggesting a distinct activation mechanism for EP1. Through extensive mutational analyses, we identify critical residues involved in PGE2 recognition, EP1 activation, and Gq protein coupling. By overcoming the challenges associated with the instability of EP1, our findings provide valuable insights into the subtype-specific activation mechanisms of EP receptors and lay the foundation for the development of more selective EP1-targeted therapeutics."
118,Approaching infinite affinity through engineering of peptide–protein interaction,Biochemistry,"Interactions between proteins normally depend on a range of noncovalent contacts. Under challenging conditions, such as with mechanical force or over long time periods, noncovalent interactions break. Unbreakable protein–protein interactions, linked by covalent bonding, provide many opportunities for robust connection of molecular building blocks, including for biomaterials, enzymes, and vaccines. When evaluating unbreakable interactions, it is important to consider whether reaction happens quickly even at low concentrations. Here we establish a genetically encoded peptide that reacts with its genetically encoded protein partner with a speed close to the limit set by diffusion. We apply a range of biophysical methods to understand the dynamics required for this interaction, demonstrating applicability to rapid and specific detection in a range of species.","Much of life’s complexity depends upon contacts between proteins with precise affinity and specificity. The successful application of engineered proteins often depends on high-stability binding to their target. In recent years, various approaches have enabled proteins to form irreversible covalent interactions with protein targets. However, the rate of such reactions is a major limitation to their use. Infinite affinity refers to the ideal where such covalent interaction occurs at the diffusion limit. Prototypes of infinite affinity pairs have been achieved using nonnatural reactive groups. After library-based evolution and rational design, here we establish a peptide–protein pair composed of the regular 20 amino acids that link together through an amide bond at a rate approaching the diffusion limit. Reaction occurs in a few minutes with both partners at low nanomolar concentration. Stopped flow fluorimetry illuminated the conformational dynamics involved in docking and reaction. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry gave insight into the conformational flexibility of this split protein and the process of enhancing its reaction rate. We applied this reactive pair for specific labeling of a plasma membrane target in 1 min on live mammalian cells. Sensitive and specific detection was also confirmed by Western blot in a range of model organisms. The peptide–protein pair allowed reconstitution of a critical mechanotransmitter in the cytosol of mammalian cells, restoring cell adhesion and migration. This simple genetic encoding for rapid irreversible reaction should provide diverse opportunities to enhance protein function by rapid detection, stable anchoring, and multiplexing of protein functionality."
119,Phylogenomics reveals the evolutionary timing and pattern of butterflies and moths,Evolution,"Lepidoptera play key roles in many biological systems. Butterflies are hypothesized to have evolved contemporaneously with flowering plants, and moths are thought to have gained anti-bat defenses in response to echolocating predatory bats, but these hypotheses have largely gone untested. Using a transcriptomic, dated evolutionary tree of Lepidoptera, we demonstrate that the most recent common ancestor of Lepidoptera is considerably older than previously hypothesized. The oldest moths in crown Lepidoptera were present in the Carboniferous, some 300 million years ago, and began to diversify largely in synchrony with angiosperms. We show that multiple lineages of moths independently evolved hearing organs well before the origin of bats, rejecting the hypothesis that lepidopteran hearing organs arose in response to these predators.","Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the major superradiations of insects, comprising nearly 160,000 described extant species. As herbivores, pollinators, and prey, Lepidoptera play a fundamental role in almost every terrestrial ecosystem. Lepidoptera are also indicators of environmental change and serve as models for research on mimicry and genetics. They have been central to the development of coevolutionary hypotheses, such as butterflies with flowering plants and moths’ evolutionary arms race with echolocating bats. However, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested, because a robust lepidopteran phylogeny and timing of evolutionary novelties are lacking. To address these issues, we inferred a comprehensive phylogeny of Lepidoptera, using the largest dataset assembled for the order (2,098 orthologous protein-coding genes from transcriptomes of 186 species, representing nearly all superfamilies), and dated it with carefully evaluated synapomorphy-based fossils. The oldest members of the Lepidoptera crown group appeared in the Late Carboniferous (∼300 Ma) and fed on nonvascular land plants. Lepidoptera evolved the tube-like proboscis in the Middle Triassic (∼241 Ma), which allowed them to acquire nectar from flowering plants. This morphological innovation, along with other traits, likely promoted the extraordinary diversification of superfamily-level lepidopteran crown groups. The ancestor of butterflies was likely nocturnal, and our results indicate that butterflies became day-flying in the Late Cretaceous (∼98 Ma). Moth hearing organs arose multiple times before the evolutionary arms race between moths and bats, perhaps initially detecting a wide range of sound frequencies before being co-opted to specifically detect bat sonar. Our study provides an essential framework for future comparative studies on butterfly and moth evolution."
120,The European Union Emissions Trading System reduced CO2 emissions despite low prices,Environmental Sciences,"International carbon markets are an appealing and increasingly popular tool to regulate carbon emissions. They put a price on carbon emissions and make pollution less attractive for regulated firms. However, carbon markets often produce prices which are deemed too low relative to the social cost of carbon. We argue that despite low prices, carbon markets can help reduce emissions. Using a statistical model and sectoral emissions data, we find that the EU ETS, which initially regulated roughly 50% of EU carbon emissions from mainly energy production and large industrial polluters, saved more than 1 billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016. This translates to reductions of 3.8% of total EU-wide emissions compared to a world without the EU ETS.","International carbon markets are an appealing and increasingly popular tool to regulate carbon emissions. By putting a price on carbon, carbon markets reshape incentives faced by firms and reduce the value of emissions. How effective are carbon markets? Observers have tended to infer their effectiveness from market prices. The general belief is that a carbon market needs a high price in order to reduce emissions. As a result, many observers remain skeptical of initiatives such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), whose price remained low (compared to the social cost of carbon). In this paper, we assess whether the EU ETS reduced  emissions despite low prices. We motivate our study by documenting that a carbon market can be effective if it is a credible institution that can plausibly become more stringent in the future. In such a case, firms might cut emissions even though market prices are low. In fact, low prices can be a signal that the demand for carbon permits weakens. Thus, low prices are compatible with successful carbon markets. To assess whether the EU ETS reduced carbon emissions even as permits were cheap, we estimate counterfactual carbon emissions using an original sectoral emissions dataset. We find that the EU ETS saved about 1.2 billion tons of  between 2008 and 2016 (3.8%) relative to a world without carbon markets, or almost half of what EU governments promised to reduce under their Kyoto Protocol commitments. Emission reductions in sectors covered under the EU ETS were higher."
121,Word embeddings quantify 100 years of gender and ethnic stereotypes,Computer Sciences,"Word embeddings are a popular machine-learning method that represents each English word by a vector, such that the geometry between these vectors captures semantic relations between the corresponding words. We demonstrate that word embeddings can be used as a powerful tool to quantify historical trends and social change. As specific applications, we develop metrics based on word embeddings to characterize how gender stereotypes and attitudes toward ethnic minorities in the United States evolved during the 20th and 21st centuries starting from 1910. Our framework opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.","Word embeddings are a powerful machine-learning framework that represents each English word by a vector. The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science."
122,Soil biodiversity and soil community composition determine ecosystem multifunctionality,Ecology,"Biological diversity is the foundation for the maintenance of ecosystems. Consequently it is thought that anthropogenic activities that reduce the diversity in ecosystems threaten ecosystem performance. A large proportion of the biodiversity within terrestrial ecosystems is hidden below ground in soils, and the impact of altering its diversity and composition on the performance of ecosystems is still poorly understood. Using a novel experimental system to alter levels of soil biodiversity and community composition, we found that reductions in the abundance and presence of soil organisms results in the decline of multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity and nutrient cycling and retention. This suggests that below-ground biodiversity is a key resource for maintaining the functioning of ecosystems.","Biodiversity loss has become a global concern as evidence accumulates that it will negatively affect ecosystem services on which society depends. So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth’s biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning. Our results indicate that changes in soil communities and the loss of soil biodiversity threaten ecosystem multifunctionality and sustainability."
123,Phylogenomics of the psychoactive mushroom genus Psilocybe and evolution of the psilocybin biosynthetic gene cluster,Evolution,"Therapeutic use of psilocybin from “magic mushrooms” is revolutionizing mental health treatment for many conditions, including depression, PTSD, and end-of-life care. However, knowledge of Psilocybe diversity and its evolutionary history is substantially incomplete. Our study presents the most extensive phylogenomic dataset across Psilocybe to date, with 23 samples derived from type specimens. Using ~3,000 single-copy gene families, we recovered a robust and well-supported phylogeny. Mapping psilocybin biosynthetic gene orthologs on the phylogeny revealed two types of gene cluster order corresponding to a deep split in the genus. Molecular dating suggests psilocybin biosynthesis arose in Psilocybe ~67 mya, concurrent with the K-Pg mass extinction event. A significant advancement in the understanding of Psilocybe evolution and psilocybin biosynthesis is presented.","Psychoactive mushrooms in the genus Psilocybe have immense cultural value and have been used for centuries in Mesoamerica. Despite the recent surge of interest in these mushrooms due to the psychotherapeutic potential of their natural alkaloid psilocybin, their phylogeny and taxonomy remain substantially incomplete. Moreover, the recent elucidation of the psilocybin biosynthetic gene cluster is known for only five of ~165 species of Psilocybe, four of which belong to only one of two major clades. We set out to improve the phylogeny of Psilocybe using shotgun sequencing of fungarium specimens, from which we obtained 71 metagenomes including from 23 types, and conducting phylogenomic analysis of 2,983 single-copy gene families to generate a fully supported phylogeny. Molecular clock analysis suggests the stem lineage of Psilocybe arose ~67 mya and diversified ~56 mya. We also show that psilocybin biosynthesis first arose in Psilocybe, with 4 to 5 possible horizontal transfers to other mushrooms between 40 and 9 mya. Moreover, predicted orthologs of the psilocybin biosynthetic genes revealed two distinct gene orders within the biosynthetic gene cluster that corresponds to a deep split within the genus, possibly a signature of two independent acquisitions of the cluster within Psilocybe."
124,COVID-19 lockdown effects on adolescent brain structure suggest accelerated maturation that is more pronounced in females than in males,Neuroscience,"We report that the lockdown measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unusually accelerated brain maturation in adolescents and that this accelerated maturation was much more pronounced in females than in males. These findings indicate greater vulnerability of the female brain, as compared to the male brain, to the lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic lockdowns. They additionally provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for alterations in adolescent mental health and other behaviors associated with the lockdowns. Since accelerated brain maturation has been associated with increased risk for the development of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders, these findings highlight the importance of providing ongoing monitoring and support to individuals who were adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adolescence is a period of substantial social–emotional development, accompanied by dramatic changes to brain structure and function. Social isolation due to lockdowns that were imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on adolescent mental health, with the mental health of females more affected than males. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns on adolescent brain structure with a focus on sex differences. We collected MRI structural data longitudinally from adolescents prior to and after the pandemic lockdowns. The pre-COVID data were used to create a normative model of cortical thickness change with age during typical adolescent development. Cortical thickness values in the post-COVID data were compared to this normative model. The analysis revealed accelerated cortical thinning in the post-COVID brain, which was more widespread throughout the brain and greater in magnitude in females than in males. When measured in terms of equivalent years of development, the mean acceleration was found to be 4.2 y in females and 1.4 y in males. Accelerated brain maturation as a result of chronic stress or adversity during development has been well documented. These findings suggest that the lifestyle disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns caused changes in brain biology and had a more severe impact on the female than the male brain."
125,The Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans originated in central Mexico rather than the Andes,Agricultural Sciences,"The potato late blight pathogen was introduced to Europe in the 1840s and caused the devastating loss of a staple crop, resulting in the Irish potato famine and subsequent diaspora. Research on this disease has engendered much debate, which in recent years has focused on whether the geographic origin of the pathogen is South America or central Mexico. Different lines of evidence support each hypothesis. We sequenced four nuclear genes in representative samples from Mexico and the South American Andes. An Andean origin of P. infestans does not receive support from detailed analyses of Andean and Mexican populations. This is one of a few examples of a pathogen with a known origin that is secondary to its current major host.","Phytophthora infestans is a destructive plant pathogen best known for causing the disease that triggered the Irish potato famine and remains the most costly potato pathogen to manage worldwide. Identification of P. infestan’s elusive center of origin is critical to understanding the mechanisms of repeated global emergence of this pathogen. There are two competing theories, placing the origin in either South America or in central Mexico, both of which are centers of diversity of Solanum host plants. To test these competing hypotheses, we conducted detailed phylogeographic and approximate Bayesian computation analyses, which are suitable approaches to unraveling complex demographic histories. Our analyses used microsatellite markers and sequences of four nuclear genes sampled from populations in the Andes, Mexico, and elsewhere. To infer the ancestral state, we included the closest known relatives Phytophthora phaseoli, Phytophthora mirabilis, and Phytophthora ipomoeae, as well as the interspecific hybrid Phytophthora andina. We did not find support for an Andean origin of P. infestans; rather, the sequence data suggest a Mexican origin. Our findings support the hypothesis that populations found in the Andes are descendants of the Mexican populations and reconcile previous findings of ancestral variation in the Andes. Although centers of origin are well documented as centers of evolution and diversity for numerous crop plants, the number of plant pathogens with a known geographic origin are limited. This work has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of hosts and pathogens, as well as the harnessing of plant disease resistance to manage late blight."
126,NEUROD1 efficiently converts peripheral blood cells into neurons with partial reprogramming by pluripotency factors,Cell Biology,"Here, we report a procedure for converting peripheral blood cells into functional neurons. Our method utilizes partial reprogramming strategies with Yamanaka reprogramming factors and the neuronal bHLH NEUROD1 to overcome epigenetic barriers. Cells produced through this process exhibit characteristics and genetic signatures similar to those of glutamatergic neurons. This method offers a minimally invasive and rapid culture protocol that can significantly advance the generation of patient-specific neurons for disease modeling and therapeutic development. While the conversion of blood cells into functional neurons has already been demonstrated earlier, the method reported in the current study introduces a different set of genes using viral vectors, significantly improving cell survival.","The direct reprogramming of cells has tremendous potential in in vitro neurological studies. Previous attempts to convert blood cells into induced neurons have presented several challenges, necessitating a less invasive, efficient, rapid, and convenient approach. The current study introduces an optimized method for converting somatic cells into neurons using a nonsurgical approach that employs peripheral blood cells as an alternative source to fibroblasts. We have demonstrated the efficacy of a unique combination of transcription factors, including NEUROD1, and four Yamanaka reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), in generating glutamatergic neurons within 3 wk. This approach, which requires only five pivotal factors (NEUROD1, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), has the potential to create functional neurons and circumvents the need for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) intermediates, as evidenced by single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, along with lineage-tracing experiments using Cre-LoxP system. While fibroblasts have been widely used for neuronal reprogramming, our findings suggest that peripheral blood cells offer a potential alternative, particularly in contexts where minimally invasive sampling and procedures convenient for patients are emphasized. This method provides a rapid strategy for modeling neuronal diseases and contributes to advancements in drug discovery and personalized medicine."
127,β-Amyloid accumulation in the human brain after one night of sleep deprivation,Neuroscience,"There has been an emerging interest in sleep and its association with β-amyloid burden as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Despite the evidence that acute sleep deprivation elevates β-amyloid levels in mouse interstitial fluid and in human cerebrospinal fluid, not much is known about the impact of sleep deprivation on β-amyloid burden in the human brain. Using positron emission tomography, here we show that acute sleep deprivation impacts β-amyloid burden in brain regions that have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Our observations provide preliminary evidence for the negative effect of sleep deprivation on β-amyloid burden in the human brain.","The effects of acute sleep deprivation on β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance in the human brain have not been documented. Here we used PET and 18F-florbetaben to measure brain Aβ burden (ABB) in 20 healthy controls tested after a night of rested sleep (baseline) and after a night of sleep deprivation. We show that one night of sleep deprivation, relative to baseline, resulted in a significant increase in Aβ burden in the right hippocampus and thalamus. These increases were associated with mood worsening following sleep deprivation, but were not related to the genetic risk (APOE genotype) for Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, baseline ABB in a range of subcortical regions and the precuneus was inversely associated with reported night sleep hours. APOE genotyping was also linked to subcortical ABB, suggesting that different Alzheimer’s disease risk factors might independently affect ABB in nearby brain regions. In summary, our findings show adverse effects of one-night sleep deprivation on brain ABB and expand on prior findings of higher Aβ accumulation with chronic less sleep."
128,Transfer learning to leverage larger datasets for improved prediction of protein stability changes,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Single amino acid mutations can have a dramatic effect on protein thermostability and, therefore, function. Mutations that unfold tumor suppressors are implicated in a variety of cancers, and mutations that stabilize proteins can be used to increase their usefulness as therapeutics or research reagents. Accurate in silico prediction of the effect of point mutations on protein stability would be useful for understanding mutations implicated in disease and for engineering protein-based medicines. In this work, we present a deep learning–based method for predicting stability changes quickly and accurately given only an initial protein structure.","Amino acid mutations that lower a protein’s thermodynamic stability are implicated in numerous diseases, and engineered proteins with enhanced stability can be important in research and medicine. Computational methods for predicting how mutations perturb protein stability are, therefore, of great interest. Despite recent advancements in protein design using deep learning, in silico prediction of stability changes has remained challenging, in part due to a lack of large, high-quality training datasets for model development. Here, we describe ThermoMPNN, a deep neural network trained to predict stability changes for protein point mutations given an initial structure. In doing so, we demonstrate the utility of a recently released megascale stability dataset for training a robust stability model. We also employ transfer learning to leverage a second, larger dataset by using learned features extracted from ProteinMPNN, a deep neural network trained to predict a protein’s amino acid sequence given its three-dimensional structure. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets using a lightweight model architecture that allows for rapid, scalable predictions. Finally, we make ThermoMPNN readily available as a tool for stability prediction and design."
129,"Structure in conversation: Evidence for the vocabulary, semantics, and syntax of prosody",Computer Sciences,"In conversation, prosody complements words, forming a structured communication system distinct from, yet connected to, text. By analyzing large datasets of spontaneous conversations and clustering similar snippets of speech, we identify the fundamental building blocks of this system. Our findings reveal a prosodic vocabulary of a few hundred patterns (far fewer than the thousands of words in a core verbal vocabulary), which fulfill interactional and attitudinal functions. Just as syntax governs word combinations, we observe recurring prosodic structures where certain patterns follow others more frequently than chance. Such ubiquitous pairs were not detected in scripted speech. These results provide data-driven support for the analogy of prosody to a linguistic system with its own vocabulary, semantics, and a simple syntax.","Prosody, the musical facet of speech, is pivotal in human communication, and its structure and meaning remain subjects of ongoing research. In this study, we introduce a data-driven model for English prosody, based on large-scale analysis of spontaneous conversations. As a first step, we identify approximately 200 discernible prosodic patterns—which we view as building blocks of the prosodic vocabulary—and outline their properties and range of meanings. Next, we reveal a Markovian logic, akin to a syntax, for concatenating these elementary building blocks into coherent utterances. We identify distinct compound functions associated with pairs of consecutive patterns and show that the Markovian syntax is more prevalent in spontaneous prosody, as compared to scripted speech. These findings offer invaluable insights into the underlying mechanisms of conversational prosody: They empirically inform and refine existing theoretical concepts. The methodology we present, combining unsupervised analysis of large datasets of spontaneous speech with manual sampling of the results, could guide future research aimed at refining our model and expanding it to other languages."
130,Integrin-activating Yersinia protein Invasin sustains long-term expansion of primary epithelial cells as 2D organoid sheets,Biochemistry,"This study introduces Invasin as a defined, affordable, and animal-free alternative to Matrigel® for culturing primary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that Invasin supports sustained, long-term expansion of epithelial cells in a 2D format, offering key advantages over the traditional 3D organoid culture system. This approach facilitates imaging, functional assays, and high-throughput screening, with broad implications for biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications.","Matrigel®/BME®, a basement membrane-like preparation, supports long-term growth of epithelial 3D organoids from adult stem cells [T. Sato et al., Nature 459, 262–265 (2009); T. Sato et al., Gastroenterology 141, 1762–1772 (2011)]. Here, we show that interaction between Matrigel’s major component laminin-111 with epithelial α6β1-integrin is crucial for this process. The outer membrane protein Invasin of Yersinia is known to activate multiple integrin–β1 complexes, including integrin α6β1. A C-terminal integrin-binding fragment of Invasin, coated on culture plates, mediated gut epithelial cell adhesion. Addition of organoid growth factors allowed multipassage expansion in 2D. Polarization, junction formation, and generation of enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells were stable over time. Sustained expansion of other human, mouse, and even snake epithelia was accomplished under comparable conditions. The 2D “organoid sheet” format holds advantages over the 3D “in gel” format in terms of imaging, accessibility of basal and apical domains, and automation for high-throughput screening. Invasin represents a fully defined, affordable, versatile, and animal-free complement to Matrigel®/BME®."
131,Antibody reactivity against EBNA1 and GlialCAM differentiates multiple sclerosis patients from healthy controls,Immunology and Inflammation,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the brain and spinal cord, leading to disability in young adults. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a prerequisite for developing the disease. We previously demonstrated that antibody responses against the virus protein EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) cross-react with brain proteins of MS patients and contribute to the disease. Here, we confirm in a large cohort of MS patients and controls that the presence of these antibodies increases the risk for MS, and we correlate them with the major genetic risk factor for MS. A combination of multiple antibodies and the genetic risk factor increases the risk for MS in an additive fashion.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is linked to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, preceding the disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology."
132,Deep learning improves prediction of drug–drug and drug–food interactions,Systems Biology,"Drug interactions, including drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and drug–food constituent interactions, can trigger unexpected pharmacological effects such as adverse drug events (ADEs). Several existing methods predict drug interactions, but require detailed, but often unavailable drug information as inputs, such as drug targets. To this end, we present a computational framework DeepDDI that accurately predicts DDI types for given drug pairs and drug–food constituent pairs using only name and structural information as inputs. We show four applications of DeepDDI to better understand drug interactions, including prediction of DDI mechanisms causing ADEs, suggestion of alternative drug members for the intended pharmacological effects without negative health effects, prediction of the effects of food constituents on interacting drugs, and prediction of bioactivities of food constituents.","Drug interactions, including drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and drug–food constituent interactions (DFIs), can trigger unexpected pharmacological effects, including adverse drug events (ADEs), with causal mechanisms often unknown. Several computational methods have been developed to better understand drug interactions, especially for DDIs. However, these methods do not provide sufficient details beyond the chance of DDI occurrence, or require detailed drug information often unavailable for DDI prediction. Here, we report development of a computational framework DeepDDI that uses names of drug–drug or drug–food constituent pairs and their structural information as inputs to accurately generate 86 important DDI types as outputs of human-readable sentences. DeepDDI uses deep neural network with its optimized prediction performance and predicts 86 DDI types with a mean accuracy of 92.4% using the DrugBank gold standard DDI dataset covering 192,284 DDIs contributed by 191,878 drug pairs. DeepDDI is used to suggest potential causal mechanisms for the reported ADEs of 9,284 drug pairs, and also predict alternative drug candidates for 62,707 drug pairs having negative health effects. Furthermore, DeepDDI is applied to 3,288,157 drug–food constituent pairs (2,159 approved drugs and 1,523 well-characterized food constituents) to predict DFIs. The effects of 256 food constituents on pharmacological effects of interacting drugs and bioactivities of 149 food constituents are predicted. These results suggest that DeepDDI can provide important information on drug prescription and even dietary suggestions while taking certain drugs and also guidelines during drug development."
133,Concomitant formation of protocells and prebiotic compounds under a plausible early Earth atmosphere,"Earth, Atmospheric, And Planetary Sciences","Miller–Urey experiments demonstrated that prebiotic organic compounds can be synthesized from a reducing atmosphere, alkaline water, and electrical discharges. We show that in these experiments, only in the presence of water, silica induces the formation of a solid organic film made of polymers of hydrogen cyanide. In these films, we found nano- to micron-size biomorphic protocells forming through a mechanism of bubbling and water–gas interfacial precipitation. Our results suggest that protocells and the key molecules of life already coexisted on the earliest Earth, setting stage for the emergence of life and additional criteria for life detection. These organic “protoworlds” could be widely distributed across the universe on any Earth-like body where they might follow different evolutionary paths.","Revealing the origin of life and unambiguously detecting fossil remains of the earliest organisms are closely related aspects of the same scientific research. The synthesis of prebiotic molecular building blocks of life and the first compartmentalization into protocells have been considered two events apart in time, space, or both. We conducted lightning experiments in borosilicate reactors filled with a mixture of gases mimicking plausible geochemical conditions of early Earth. In addition to the variety of prebiotic organic molecules synthesized in these experiments, we investigated the micrometer-thick silica-induced organic film that covers the walls of the reactors and floats at the water–gas interface. We found that the film is formed by aggregation of HCN-polymer nanoclusters whenever water is present, either in the liquid or vapor phase. The organic film morphs into micrometer-scale biomorphic vesicular structures hanging from the organic film into the water. We also show that these structures are hollow and may act as microreactors facilitating chemical pathways toward increasing complexity. We propose that these organic biomorphs form through a bubble-driven mechanism and interfacial precipitation of HCN-polymers. The concomitant synthesis of biomorphic poly-HCN protocells and prebiotic molecules under plausible geochemical conditions of early Earth-like planets and moons and opens a different geochemical scenario for the emergence of life. Our results suggest that the coexistence of molecular building blocks of life and submicron biomorphic structures in the oldest rocks on Earth or any other celestial body does not necessarily mean evidence of life."
134,Characterization and engineering of a two-enzyme system for plastics depolymerization,Biochemistry,"Deconstruction of recalcitrant polymers, such as cellulose or chitin, is accomplished in nature by synergistic enzyme cocktails that evolved over millions of years. In these systems, soluble dimeric or oligomeric intermediates are typically released via interfacial biocatalysis, and additional enzymes often process the soluble intermediates into monomers for microbial uptake. The recent discovery of a two-enzyme system for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) deconstruction, which employs one enzyme to convert the polymer into soluble intermediates and another enzyme to produce the constituent PET monomers (MHETase), suggests that nature may be evolving similar deconstruction strategies for synthetic plastics. This study on the characterization of the MHETase enzyme and synergy of the two-enzyme PET depolymerization system may inform enzyme cocktail-based strategies for plastics upcycling.","Plastics pollution represents a global environmental crisis. In response, microbes are evolving the capacity to utilize synthetic polymers as carbon and energy sources. Recently, Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to secrete a two-enzyme system to deconstruct polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to its constituent monomers. Specifically, the I. sakaiensis PETase depolymerizes PET, liberating soluble products, including mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), which is cleaved to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol by MHETase. Here, we report a 1.6 Å resolution MHETase structure, illustrating that the MHETase core domain is similar to PETase, capped by a lid domain. Simulations of the catalytic itinerary predict that MHETase follows the canonical two-step serine hydrolase mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that MHETase evolved from ferulic acid esterases, and two homologous enzymes are shown to exhibit MHET turnover. Analysis of the two homologous enzymes and the MHETase S131G mutant demonstrates the importance of this residue for accommodation of MHET in the active site. We also demonstrate that the MHETase lid is crucial for hydrolysis of MHET and, furthermore, that MHETase does not turnover mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-furanoate or mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-isophthalate. A highly synergistic relationship between PETase and MHETase was observed for the conversion of amorphous PET film to monomers across all nonzero MHETase concentrations tested. Finally, we compare the performance of MHETase:PETase chimeric proteins of varying linker lengths, which all exhibit improved PET and MHET turnover relative to the free enzymes. Together, these results offer insights into the two-enzyme PET depolymerization system and will inform future efforts in the biological deconstruction and upcycling of mixed plastics."
135,Global urban population exposure to extreme heat,Sustainability Science,"Increased extreme heat exposure from both climate change and the urban heat island effect threatens rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide. Yet, because we do not know where urban population growth and extreme heat intersect, we have limited capacity to reduce the impacts of urban extreme heat exposure. Here, we leverage fine-resolution temperature and population data to measure urban extreme heat exposure for 13,115 cities from 1983 to 2016. Globally, urban exposure increased nearly 200%, affecting 1.7 billion people. Total urban warming elevated exposure rates 52% above population growth alone. However, spatially heterogeneous exposure patterns highlight an urgent need for locally tailored adaptations and early warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure across the planet’s diverse urban settlements.","Increased exposure to extreme heat from both climate change and the urban heat island effect—total urban warming—threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide. Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution temporal analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We harmonize global, fine-resolution (0.05°), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We measure the average annual rate of increase in exposure (person-days/year−1) at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus total urban warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature threshold of 30 °C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016. Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52% compared to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet’s population (1.7 billion people). However, how total urban warming and population growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous. This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat exposure metrics to identify local patterns and compare exposure trends across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted adaptations and early warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure."
136,Patterns of linguistic simplification on social media platforms over time,Applied Physical Sciences,"Our study investigates the complexity of user comments across multiple digital platforms and topics, analyzing a large dataset of about 300 million English comments. Findings reveal a consistent trend of decreasing text length and lexical richness, yet users consistently introduce new words at a stable rate in their comments. This pattern suggests that linguistic changes on social media reflect a broader, universal aspect of human behavior rather than platform-specific influences. This insight contributes to understanding how digital environments shape communication norms and user engagement.","Understanding the impact of digital platforms on user behavior presents foundational challenges, including issues related to polarization, misinformation dynamics, and variation in news consumption. Comparative analyses across platforms and over different years can provide critical insights into these phenomena. This study investigates the linguistic characteristics of user comments over 34 y, focusing on their complexity and temporal shifts. Using a dataset of approximately 300 million English comments from eight diverse platforms and topics, we examine user communications’ vocabulary size and linguistic richness and their evolution over time. Our findings reveal consistent patterns of complexity across social media platforms and topics, characterized by a nearly universal reduction in text length, diminished lexical richness, and decreased repetitiveness. Despite these trends, users consistently introduce new words into their comments at a nearly constant rate. This analysis underscores that platforms only partially influence the complexity of user comments but, instead, it reflects a broader pattern of linguistic change driven by social triggers, suggesting intrinsic tendencies in users’ online interactions comparable to historically recognized linguistic hybridization and contamination processes."
137,NAD+ supplementation reduces neuroinflammation and cell senescence in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease via cGAS–STING,Neuroscience,"Impaired neuronal bioenergetics and neuroinflammation are thought to play key roles in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their interplay is not clear. AD mouse brains showed lower nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and alterations in inflammation. Treatment of AD mice with NR reduced neuroinflammation, attenuated DNA damage, and prevented cellular senescence. We present evidence that the beneficial effects of nicotinamide riboside (NR) are, in part, through a cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent pathway. DNA damage was increased in AD and attenuated by NR. Both cGAS–STING and NAD+ pathways are potential therapeutic targets for AD.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Impaired neuronal bioenergetics and neuroinflammation are thought to play key roles in the progression of AD, but their interplay is not clear. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an important metabolite in all human cells in which it is pivotal for multiple processes including DNA repair and mitophagy, both of which are impaired in AD neurons. Here, we report that levels of NAD+ are reduced and markers of inflammation increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mutant transgenic mice with beta-amyloid pathology. Treatment of APP/PS1 mutant mice with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) for 5 mo increased brain NAD+ levels, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased activation of microglia and astrocytes. NR treatment also reduced NLRP3 inflammasome expression, DNA damage, apoptosis, and cellular senescence in the AD mouse brains. Activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are associated with DNA damage and senescence. cGAS–STING elevation was observed in the AD mice and normalized by NR treatment. Cell culture experiments using microglia suggested that the beneficial effects of NR are, in part, through a cGAS–STING-dependent pathway. Levels of ectopic (cytoplasmic) DNA were increased in APP/PS1 mutant mice and human AD fibroblasts and down-regulated by NR. NR treatment induced mitophagy and improved cognitive and synaptic functions in APP/PS1 mutant mice. Our findings suggest a role for NAD+ depletion-mediated activation of cGAS–STING in neuroinflammation and cellular senescence in AD."
138,The rising income gradient in life expectancy in Sweden over six decades,Economic Sciences,"This study reveals that the income gradient in life expectancy in Sweden has steadily increased since the 1960s, despite a reduction in income inequality until 1990. This challenges the “absolute income hypothesis”—the notion that economic resources per se affect life expectancy and that increasing income inequality directly drives health disparities. Instead, a “third factor” appears to be associated with both income and life expectancy, leading to greater gains in life expectancy among higher income groups. These gains are evident in both preventable and treatable disease mortality and appear more strongly for preventable causes, suggesting that higher-income individuals are more rapidly adopting healthier lifestyles. This finding highlights the need to consider factors beyond economic resources in addressing health inequalities.","This study examines the long-term association between income and life expectancy in Sweden between 1960 and 2021. The study is based on register data that include all Swedish permanent residents aged 40 y and older. The results show that the gap in life expectancy between the top and bottom income percentiles widened substantially: For men, it increased from 3.5 y in the 1960s to 10.9 y by the 2010s, and for women, from 3.8 y in the 1970s to 8.6 y by the 2010s. Despite a reduction in income inequality and an expansion of social spending from the 1960s to the 1990s, health inequality continuously increased over the period under study. The changes of the relation between real income and life expectancy, the so-called Preston curve, reveal a much faster improvement in life expectancy in the upper half of the income distribution than suggested by the cross-sectional relation between income and life expectancy. Analysis of causes of death identified circulatory diseases as the main contributor to improved longevity, while cancer contributed more to the increased gap in life expectancy for women and equally for men. Finally, analysis of the change in the income gradient in avoidable causes of death showed the strongest contribution of preventable causes, both for men and women."
139,Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"This study compares the accuracy of personality judgment—a ubiquitous and important social-cognitive activity—between computer models and humans. Using several criteria, we show that computers’ judgments of people’s personalities based on their digital footprints are more accurate and valid than judgments made by their close others or acquaintances (friends, family, spouse, colleagues, etc.). Our findings highlight that people’s personalities can be predicted automatically and without involving human social-cognitive skills.","Judging others’ personalities is an essential skill in successful social living, as personality is a key driver behind people’s interactions, behaviors, and emotions. Although accurate personality judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants’ Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher interjudge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy."
140,Five computational developability guidelines for therapeutic antibody profiling,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Immunogenicity, instability, self-association, high viscosity, polyspecificity, or poor expression can all preclude an antibody from becoming a therapeutic. Early identification of these negative characteristics is essential. Akin to the Lipinski guidelines, which measure druglikeness in small molecules, our Therapeutic Antibody Profiler highlights antibodies that possess characteristics that are rare/unseen in clinical-stage mAb therapeutics. The only required input is the variable domain sequence. We show examples where our approach would have advised against manufacturing antibodies that were found to aggregate or have poor expression.","Therapeutic mAbs must not only bind to their target but must also be free from “developability issues” such as poor stability or high levels of aggregation. While small-molecule drug discovery benefits from Lipinski’s rule of five to guide the selection of molecules with appropriate biophysical properties, there is currently no in silico analog for antibody design. Here, we model the variable domain structures of a large set of post-phase-I clinical-stage antibody therapeutics (CSTs) and calculate in silico metrics to estimate their typical properties. In each case, we contextualize the CST distribution against a snapshot of the human antibody gene repertoire. We describe guideline values for five metrics thought to be implicated in poor developability: the total length of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), the extent and magnitude of surface hydrophobicity, positive charge and negative charge in the CDRs, and asymmetry in the net heavy- and light-chain surface charges. The guideline cutoffs for each property were derived from the values seen in CSTs, and a flagging system is proposed to identify nonconforming candidates. On two mAb drug discovery sets, we were able to selectively highlight sequences with developability issues. We make available the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP), a computational tool that builds downloadable homology models of variable domain sequences, tests them against our five developability guidelines, and reports potential sequence liabilities and canonical forms. TAP is freely available at opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/TAP.php."
141,Vertebrates on the brink as indicators of biological annihilation and the sixth mass extinction,Enivornmental Sciences,"The ongoing sixth mass extinction may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible. Thousands of populations of critically endangered vertebrate animal species have been lost in a century, indicating that the sixth mass extinction is human caused and accelerating. The acceleration of the extinction crisis is certain because of the still fast growth in human numbers and consumption rates. In addition, species are links in ecosystems, and, as they fall out, the species they interact with are likely to go also. In the regions where disappearing species are concentrated, regional biodiversity collapses are likely occurring. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking massive global actions to save humanity’s crucial life-support systems.","The ongoing sixth mass species extinction is the result of the destruction of component populations leading to eventual extirpation of entire species. Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear—extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity’s crucial life-support systems from this existential threat."
142,Legacy of a magic gene—CCR5-∆32: From discovery to clinical benefit in a generation,Genetics,"Important advances in human genetics and medicine occurred in parallel since the late 20th century. I tell here a personal historical perspective of the search for discovery and translation of AIDS Restriction Genes (ARGs), human loci with polymorphic variants that influence the outcome of HIV-1 exposure, infection, AIDS progression, or treatment. We employed the principles of population genetics to describe some 36 AIDS restriction genes of interest including CCR5-∆32, a common genetic variant that prevents HIV-1 infection in homozygous carriers. The translation for AIDS and other important diseases created a harbinger for the developing discipline of genetic epidemiology. As a research director at NIH, I began a search for human genes that influence prognoses of patients exposed or infected with HIV.","The discovery of the 32-bp deletion allele of the chemokine receptor gene CCR5 showed that homozygous carriers display near-complete resistance to HIV infection, irrespective of exposure. Algorithms of molecular evolutionary theory suggested that the CCR5-∆32 mutation occurred but once in the last millennium and rose by strong selective pressure relatively recently to a ~10% allele frequency in Europeans. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that CCR5-∆32 was selected due to its protective influence to resist Yersinia pestis, the agent of the Black Death/bubonic plague of the 14th century. Powerful anti-AIDS entry inhibitors targeting CCR5 were developed as a treatment for HIV patients, particularly those whose systems had developed resistance to powerful anti-retroviral therapies. Homozygous CCR5-∆32/∆32 stem cell transplant donors were used to produce HIV-cleared AIDS patients in at least five “cures” of HIV infection. CCR5 has also been implicated in regulating infection with Staphylococcus aureus, in recovery from stroke, and in ablation of the fatal graft versus host disease (GVHD) in cancer transplant patients. While homozygous CCR5-∆32/32 carriers block HIV infection, alternatively they display an increased risk for encephalomyelitis and death when infected with the West Nile virus."
143,Localized tension–induced giant folding in unstructured elastic sheets,Applied Mathematics,"While a slender object is naturally expected to buckle when compressed, other objects (including the bones in human fingers) can achieve the same behavior when pulled. This unusual behavior has been used in applications like soft-robotic grippers, but is often assumed to originate from some unusual microscopic structure e.g. particular patterns of cuts in an otherwise isotropic sheet. We show that the geometry with which the imposed pulling is applied is key, allowing this behavior to be observed even in unstructured, and uniform materials. We use a combination of experiments, mathematical modeling and numerical simulations, to understand its origins and how it can be controlled; this understanding gives insights into the design of such behavior in more complex systems.","Buckling in compression is the archetype of elastic instability: when compressed along its longest dimension, a thin structure such as a playing card will buckle out-of-plane accommodating the imposed compression without a significant change of length. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to sheets with microscopic structure leads to out-of-plane deformation in applications from “groovy metasheets” for multistable morphing to kirigami grippers. Here, we demonstrate that this counterintuitive behavior—a large transverse folding induced by a relatively small imposed longitudinal tension—occurs also in unstructured sheets of isotropic material. The key to this behavior is that a localized uniaxial tension induces giant folding; we refer to this as “localized tension-induced giant (TUG) folding” to reflect the importance of localized tension, and its mode of actuation and the similarity of the loading condition to ‘tugging’ the sheet. We show that localized TUG folding occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression—a geometric consequence of a localized applied tension. We determine scaling results for the folding angle as a function of applied strain in agreement with both experiments and simulations. The generic nature of localized TUG folding suggests that it might be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures than previously realized."
144,Dmrt2 and Hmx2 direct intercalated cell diversity in the mammalian kidney through antagonistic and supporting regulatory processes,Developmental Biology,"Subtypes of intercalated cells in the mammalian kidney arise from multiple lineages and regulate circulatory pH homeostasis through opposing actions on ion transport. Subtype diversity correlates with mutually exclusive expression of the transcriptional regulators Dmrt2 and Hmx2/Hmx3. Subtype-enriched activity of these transcription factors is shown to drive IC diversity, an insight that will inform approaches to engineer functional kidney surrogates.","Intercalated cells (ICs) in the mammalian kidney regulate circulatory pH through IC subtype–restricted actions of bicarbonate transporters: pH is elevated by Slc4a1 restricted to type A-ICs (A-ICs) and depressed by Slc26a4 in type B-IC (B-ICs). NonA-nonB-ICs (nA/nB-ICs) also produce Slc26a4 though their function is unclear. Though both nephron and ureteric progenitor lineages generate A-ICs, the former also generates nA/nB-ICs and the latter B-ICs. Lineage and cell type restricted transporter gene expression in the mouse and human kidney is preceded by expression of the transcriptional regulators Dmrt2/DMRT2 in A-ICs, and either, or both, Hmx2/HMX2 and Hmx3/HMX3 in B- and nA/nB ICs. CRISPR/Cas9-directed removal of Dmrt2 and the linked Hmx2/Hmx3 genes resulted in IC-subtype switching. A-ICs adopted an Hmx2+/Slc26a4+ B-IC cell fate on Dmrt2 removal while B-ICs initiated a Dmrt2+/Slc4a1+ A-IC program on Hmx2/Hmx3 removal. Triple knockout of Dmrt2, Hmx2, and Hmx3 resulted in hybrid ICs expressing both Slc4a1 and Slc26a4. Thus, restricted expression of these regulators is essential for specifying IC subtypes. To explore these mechanisms, Hmx2 and Dmrt2 were activated ectopically in ureteric organoid cultures. Introduction of Foxi1—a pan determinant of ICs—activated early Dmrt2+ A-IC development while cointroduction of Hmx2 silenced Foxi1-dependent Dmrt2 expression and led to an upregulation of Slc26a4. In contrast, coexpression of Foxi1 and Dmrt2 upregulated Slc4a1. These data support a model in which mutually repressive interactions between Dmrt2 and Hmx2/3 establish distinct IC identities and ongoing activity of these factors supports gene regulatory programs specific to each IC subtype."
145,Land-use and climate change risks in the Amazon and the need of a novel sustainable development paradigm,"Earth, Atmospheric, And Planetary Sciences","The Amazonian tropical forests have been disappearing at a fast rate in the last 50 y due to deforestation to open areas for agriculture, posing high risks of irreversible changes to biodiversity and ecosystems. Climate change poses additional risks to the stability of the forests. Studies suggest “tipping points” not to be transgressed: 4° C of global warming or 40% of total deforested area. The regional development debate has focused on attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation with intensification of traditional agriculture. Large reductions of deforestation in the last decade open up opportunities for an alternative model based on seeing the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets for the creation of high-value products and ecosystem services.","For half a century, the process of economic integration of the Amazon has been based on intensive use of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources, which has brought significant basin-wide environmental alterations. The rural development in the Amazonia pushed the agricultural frontier swiftly, resulting in widespread land-cover change, but agriculture in the Amazon has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two “tipping points,” namely, temperature increase of 4 °C or deforestation exceeding 40% of the forest area. If transgressed, large-scale “savannization” of mostly southern and eastern Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 °C over the last 60 y, and total deforestation is reaching 20% of the forested area. The recent significant reductions in deforestation—80% reduction in the Brazilian Amazon in the last decade—opens up opportunities for a novel sustainable development paradigm for the future of the Amazon. We argue for a new development paradigm—away from only attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation versus intensification of traditional agriculture and expansion of hydropower capacity—in which we research, develop, and scale a high-tech innovation approach that sees the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets that can enable the creation of innovative high-value products, services, and platforms through combining advanced digital, biological, and material technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in progress."
146,Next-generation rifamycins for the treatment of mycobacterial infections,Pharmacology,"Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease is a growing global health crisis due to limited therapeutic options and emerging drug-resistant strains. To address this unmet clinical need, we are developing oral rifamycins with enhanced antibacterial potency, reduced drug–drug interactions, and improved pharmacological properties. Their superior efficacy in a mouse model of infection underscores their therapeutic potential to cure M. abscessus lung disease. The preclinical candidates described here will advance to IND (investigational new drug)-enabling studies to support clinical development. These rifamycins may also find clinical utility for the treatment of TB-HIV and lung disease caused by other NTM pathogens. This is a successful drug discovery program delivering 2nd generation rifamycins with improved efficacy specifically against mycobacterial infections.","Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing nontuberculous Mycobacterium causing severe pulmonary infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals and patients with underlying lung conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF). While rifamycins are the pillar of tuberculosis treatment, their efficacy against M. abscessus lung disease is severely compromised by intrabacterial ADP-ribosylation. Additionally, rifamycins induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), a major human drug-metabolizing enzyme, further limiting their use in patients with comorbidities that require treatment with CYP3A4 substrates such as CF and HIV coinfection. We chemically reengineered rifabutin to enhance its potency against M. abscessus by blocking intrabacterial inactivation and eliminate drug–drug interactions by removing induction of CYP3A4 gene expression. We have designed and profiled a series of C25-substituted derivatives resistant to intracellular inactivation and lacking CYP3A4 induction, while retaining excellent pharmacological properties. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, devoid of ADP-ribosyltransferase, the frontrunners are equipotent to rifabutin, suggesting superior clinical utility since they no longer come with the drug interaction liability typical of rifamycins. Prioritized compounds demonstrated superior antibacterial activity against a panel of M. abscessus clinical isolates, were highly bactericidal against replicating and drug-tolerant nonreplicating bacteria in caseum surrogate and were active against intracellular bacteria. As single agents, these rifamycins were as effective as a standard-of-care four-drug combination in a murine model of M. abscessus lung infection."
147,Synthetic beta-solenoid proteins with the fragment-free computational design of a beta-hairpin extension,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"The development of algorithms to design new proteins with backbone plasticity is a key challenge in computational protein design. In this paper, we describe a class of extensible synthetic repeat protein scaffolds with computationally designed variable loops projecting from the central core. We have developed methods to sample backbone conformations computationally using a coarse-grained potential energy function without using backbone fragments from known protein structures. This procedure was combined with existing methods for sequence design to successfully design a loop at atomic level precision. Given the inherent modular and composable nature of repeat proteins, this approach allows the iterative atomic-resolution design of complex structures with potential applications in novel nanomaterials and molecular recognition.","The ability to design and construct structures with atomic level precision is one of the key goals of nanotechnology. Proteins offer an attractive target for atomic design because they can be synthesized chemically or biologically and can self-assemble. However, the generalized protein folding and design problem is unsolved. One approach to simplifying the problem is to use a repetitive protein as a scaffold. Repeat proteins are intrinsically modular, and their folding and structures are better understood than large globular domains. Here, we have developed a class of synthetic repeat proteins based on the pentapeptide repeat family of beta-solenoid proteins. We have constructed length variants of the basic scaffold and computationally designed de novo loops projecting from the scaffold core. The experimentally solved 3.56-Å resolution crystal structure of one designed loop matches closely the designed hairpin structure, showing the computational design of a backbone extension onto a synthetic protein core without the use of backbone fragments from known structures. Two other loop designs were not clearly resolved in the crystal structures, and one loop appeared to be in an incorrect conformation. We have also shown that the repeat unit can accommodate whole-domain insertions by inserting a domain into one of the designed loops."
148,Trehalose dimycolate inhibits phagosome maturation and promotes intracellular M. tuberculosis growth via noncanonical SNARE interactions,Microbiology,"Glycolipids from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell envelope, particularly trehalose dimycolate (TDM), play major roles in subverting the immune response to this intracellular pathogen. How subversion occurs is often unclear because glycans and lipids are technically challenging to study in cells. We found that a TDM-mimicking chemical probe interacts with three host Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins Receptor (SNARE) proteins, including two that regulate endosome fusion and one that does not. The presence of TDM or M. tuberculosis triggers abnormal binding of these SNAREs, which in turn inhibits the fusion of M. tuberculosis–containing phagosomes with lysosomes and promotes M. tuberculosis replication. Our work provides an unusual example of a bacterial pathogen restricting the immune response via glycolipid–SNARE interactions.","Mycobacterial cell envelopes are rich in unusual lipids and glycans that play key roles during infection and vaccination. The most abundant envelope glycolipid is trehalose dimycolate (TDM). TDM compromises the host response to mycobacterial species via multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of phagosome maturation. The molecular mechanism by which TDM inhibits phagosome maturation has been elusive. We find that a clickable, photoaffinity TDM probe recapitulates key phenotypes of native TDM in macrophage host cells and binds several host Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins Receptor (SNARE) proteins, including Vesicle Transport through Interaction with t-SNAREs 1B (VTI1B), Syntaxin 8 (STX8), and Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2 (VAMP2). VTI1B and STX8 normally promote endosome fusion by forming a complex with VAMP8. However, in the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, VTI1B and STX8 complex with VAMP2, which in turn decreases VAMP8 binding. VAMP2 acts together with mycolate structure to inhibit phagosome maturation and promotes intracellular M. tuberculosis replication. Thus one mechanism by which TDM constrains the innate immune response to M. tuberculosis is via noncanonical SNARE complexation."
149,Quadruple adenine base–edited allogeneic CAR T cells outperform CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease–engineered T cells,Immunology and Inflammation,"This study reveals that Cas9 nuclease-induced genotoxicity can compromise the fitness of gene-edited human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, thereby diminishing their therapeutic efficacy beyond the known risks of chromosomal translocations and oncogenicity associated with double-strand breaks (DSBs). We demonstrate that biosimilar therapeutic CAR T cell products generated using adenine base editors (ABEs) instead of Cas9 for multiplex gene editing can mitigate these adverse effects, exhibiting enhanced in vitro proliferation under antigen stress and improved in vivo antitumor efficacy. Our findings suggest that employing Cas9 nickase–based adenine-base editing mitigates the genotoxicity associated with nuclease-active Cas9, potentially leading to superior cellular therapies.","Genome-editing technologies have enabled the clinical development of allogeneic cellular therapies, yet the optimal gene-editing modality for multiplex editing of therapeutic T cell product manufacturing remains elusive. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease and adenine base editor (ABE) technologies in generating allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, utilizing extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses. Both methods achieved high editing efficiencies across four target genes, critical for mitigating graft-versus-host disease and allograft rejection: TRAC or CD3E, B2M, CIITA, and PVR. Notably, ABE demonstrated higher manufacturing yields and distinct off-target profiles compared to Cas9, with translocations observed exclusively in Cas9-edited products. Functionally, ABE-edited CAR T cells exhibited superior in vitro effector functions under continuous antigen stimulation, including enhanced proliferative capacity and increased surface CAR expression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ABE editing resulted in reduced activation of p53 and DNA damage response pathways at baseline, along with sustained activation of metabolic pathways during antigen stress. Consistently, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing data indicated that Cas9-edited, but not ABE-edited, CAR T cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility peaks associated with double-strand break repair and DNA damage response pathways. In a preclinical leukemia model, ABE-edited CAR T cells demonstrated improved tumor control and extended overall survival compared to their Cas9-edited counterparts. Collectively, these findings position ABE as superior to Cas9 nucleases for multiplex gene editing of therapeutic T cells."
150,Cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins by nanobody-binding scaffolds (Legobodies),Biochemistry,"Structure determination by cryo-EM is difficult or impossible to apply to proteins smaller than ∼100 kDa, excluding many membrane proteins and proteins of pharmaceutical importance from the analysis. Here, we report on a general method that allows structure determination of small proteins. The method is based on the availability of a nanobody to a target protein. The nanobody is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: 1) a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody and 2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. We call the overall ensemble Legobody. The method is demonstrated for two small proteins that have sizes of ∼22 kDa.","We describe a general method that allows structure determination of small proteins by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The method is based on the availability of a target-binding nanobody, which is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: 1) a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody and 2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. The overall ensemble of ∼120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody–target interaction, is easily recognizable in EM images due to its unique shape, and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23-kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2-Å overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22-kDa receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6-Å resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody. The Legobody approach thus overcomes the current size limitations of cryo-EM analysis."
151,Biofilm architecture determines the dissemination of conjugative plasmids,Microbiology,"Bacterial conjugation is a key driver in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Despite extensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of conjugation, the dynamics of plasmid transfer within spatially organized bacterial populations and the impact of community architecture on plasmid dissemination remain underexplored. We reveal the critical role of bacterial community architecture in modulating the efficiency of plasmid dissemination. While biofilms may serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance carried by conjugative plasmids, they might not be a structure acquiring resistance easily. Our study provides insights into the physical constraints imposed by biofilm structures on horizontal gene transfer, with potential implications for strategies aimed at controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance.","Plasmid conjugation is a contact-dependent horizontal gene transfer mechanism that significantly contributes to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. While the molecular mechanisms of conjugation have been extensively studied, our understanding of plasmid transfer dynamics within spatially structured bacterial communities and the influence of community architecture on plasmid dissemination remains limited. In this study, we use live-cell fluorescence microscopy to investigate the propagation of the broad host range RP4 conjugative plasmid in Escherichia coli populations exhibiting varying levels of spatial organization. In high-density, two-dimensional cell monolayers, direct and tight contact between donors and recipients is not only necessary but also sufficient to trigger RP4 plasmid transfer, ensuring optimal plasmid propagation. In three-dimensional mature biofilms, the emergent community architecture limits the ability of donor cells to enter regions with high cell density, which hinders the establishment of direct contacts with recipients and impedes plasmid transfer in biofilms. In contrast, microcolonies, early-stage biofilms, and biofilms with a lower surface coverage leave open access points for donor cells in regions that later emerge as high-cell-density regions in mature biofilms, which facilitates plasmid transfer. These findings reveal the crucial role of bacterial community architecture in determining the efficiency of plasmid dissemination."
152,A prolactin-targeting antibody to prevent stress-induced peripheral nociceptor sensitization and female postoperative pain,Medical Sciences,"Psychological stress is a risk factor for worsening and chronification of postoperative pain. Stress responses and postoperative pain disproportionally affect women. Stress increased circulating prolactin (PRL), sensitized rodent and human nociceptors, and increased postoperative pain hypersensitivity in female mice. Pharmacological or genetic targeting of PRL, or its receptor, inhibited nociceptor sensitization, and reduced stress-related postoperative hypersensitivity in female mice. We developed a monoclonal antibody that sequesters human PRL, prevents sensitization of female human nociceptors and decreases stress-related postsurgical pain in female mice modified to produce human PRL. Preemptive inhibition of stress-induced nociceptor sensitization with a novel monoclonal antibody to sequester PRL can improve postoperative pain, diminish the need for postoperative opioids, and decrease risks of transition to chronic pain in females.","Scheduled surgeries elicit stress in many patients. Levels of preoperative stress, anxiety, and female gender are known risk factors for increased and prolonged postoperative pain. The mechanisms by which psychological stress increases postoperative pain, especially in women, remain unknown. We hypothesized that stress amplifies postoperative pain by sensitizing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Prolactin (PRL) is a female-predominant neurohormone that is controlled by estrogen and stress. PRL signals at the prolactin receptor long (PRLR-L) and short (PRLR-S) isoforms to induce gene transcription and nociception, respectively. Critically, prolactin sensitizes female, but not male, murine, Macaque and human nociceptors, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with high translational potential for human therapy. Prior restraint stress (RS) increased the magnitude and duration of incisional injury–induced postoperative pain hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. In females, RS or incisional injury downregulated PRLR-L and increased PRL-dependent nociceptor excitability. Female selective inhibition of postoperative pain hypersensitivity was produced by a) pharmacological inhibition of pituitary PRL b) overexpression of DRG PRLR-L to bias PRL signaling away from PRLR-S and c) CRISPR/Cas9 editing of PRLR isoforms. PL200,019, our recently discovered monoclonal antibody against human PRL (hPRL), prevented hPRL-induced sensitization of human female nociceptors. Using female mice genetically modified to express hPRL, rather than murine PRL, PL200,019 prevented both stress and incisional injury–induced hypersensitivity. Preemptive inhibition of stress-induced nociceptor sensitization with a monoclonal antibody to sequester PRL can improve female postoperative pain, diminish the need for postoperative opioids and decrease the risks of transition to chronic pain."
153,Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought,Environmental Sciences,"There is evidence that the 2007−2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria. It was the worst drought in the instrumental record, causing widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers. Century-long observed trends in precipitation, temperature, and sea-level pressure, supported by climate model results, strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has increased the probability of severe and persistent droughts in this region, and made the occurrence of a 3-year drought as severe as that of 2007−2010 2 to 3 times more likely than by natural variability alone. We conclude that human influences on the climate system are implicated in the current Syrian conflict.","Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011, the greater Fertile Crescent experienced the most severe drought in the instrumental record. For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest. We show that the recent decrease in Syrian precipitation is a combination of natural variability and a long-term drying trend, and the unusual severity of the observed drought is here shown to be highly unlikely without this trend. Precipitation changes in Syria are linked to rising mean sea-level pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean, which also shows a long-term trend. There has been also a long-term warming trend in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding to the drawdown of soil moisture. No natural cause is apparent for these trends, whereas the observed drying and warming are consistent with model studies of the response to increases in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, model studies show an increasingly drier and hotter future mean climate for the Eastern Mediterranean. Analyses of observations and model simulations indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought, which is implicated in the current conflict, has become more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system."
154,Exploiting thioether reactivity to label mycobacterial glycans,Chemistry,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kills over a million people per year, making it a leading cause of death from infectious diseases globally. Mtb glycans are potent drivers of disease. We took advantage of a rare monosaccharide on these glycans–methylthioxylofuranose (MTX)–to selectively label and visualize them. By using oxaziridine bioconjugation, we can distinguish Mtb glycans from those of nonpathogenic related bacteria and detect these glycans in live bacteria and host cells. This study advances our understanding of key Mtb virulence factors and their role in bacterial physiology, allows us to track changes to these factors and their localization during infection, and paves the way for the development of a diverse and specific array of glycan bioconjugation probes.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Mtb cell envelope glycans are potent virulence factors that play key roles in mediating infection of host tissues and modulating the host immune response. However, there are few ways to site-selectively modify and label these or any glycans to study their functions in disease. This gap arises because glycans generally lack functional groups amenable to bioconjugation strategies. Methylthioxylofuranose (MTX), a rare monosaccharide in select pathogenic mycobacteria, is an exception. MTX is appended to mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), an antigenic glycolipid in the Mtb cell envelope implicated in downregulating the host immune system during infection. MTX is unique not only in its prevalence but also in its functionality—it contains a thioether not present in other glycans. We envisioned exploiting the MTX thioether to selectively label ManLAM with an oxaziridine probe. Here, we show that MTX-containing glycans can be labeled selectively in the test tube and live cells, highlighting the reactivity and accessibility of this motif. Our approach labels ManLAM efficiently despite the presence of protein methionine residues and can distinguish between different mycobacterial species. Using an oxaziridine equipped with a reporter, we could visualize ManLAM localization in live cells and a macrophage infection model, highlighting the stability of the label and the cell envelope in this environment. These studies will enable investigations of dynamic changes in a critical Mtb cell envelope component during infection. Moreover, the selective reactivity of thioethers can be leveraged to expand the repertoire of glycan bioconjugation strategies."
155,A unified framework for hydromechanical signaling can explain transmission of local and long-distance signals in plants,Plant Biology,"Plants can rapidly transduce localized stimuli into whole-plant responses through propagating signals. Decades of research suggest that hydromechanical processes, involving water flow and the transmission of mechanical stresses and strains, play a key role in plant signaling, yet the field lacks predictive models to capture these coupled processes and assess suggested hypotheses. In this work, we present a unified framework based on poroelastic dynamics with which we explore how these processes could carry biological information and show agreement of the model’s predictions with the observed dynamics of various signals. This framework provides a foundation for designing future experiments to elucidate different factors involved in signal transmission and transduction.","Local wounding in plants triggers signals that travel locally within the wounded leaf or systemically through the vasculature to distant leaves. Our understanding of the mechanisms of initiation and propagation of this ubiquitous class of signals remains incomplete. Here, we develop a unifying framework based on poroelastic dynamics to study two coupled biophysical processes—propagation of pressure changes and transmission of chemical elicitors via mass flows driven by these pressure changes—as potential mechanisms for the initiation and propagation of wound-induced signals. We show that rapid pressure changes in the xylem can transmit mechanical information across the plant, while their coupling with neighboring nonvascular tissue drives swelling and mass flow that can transport chemical elicitors to distant leaves. We confront predictions from our model with measurements of signaling dynamics in several species to show that i) the poroelastic model can capture the observed dynamics of purely mechanical changes (swelling of distant leaves) induced by wounding; ii) advection and diffusion of hypothetical elicitors with mass flows induced by poroelastic relaxations can explain distant cellular responses observed with gene-encoded reporters of cytosolic calcium concentration and electrical signals; and iii) poroelastic diffusion of pressure changes around local wounds in nonvascular tissue matches the observed cytosolic calcium signals and represents an alternative hypothesis relative to molecular diffusion of chemical elicitors. This framework provides a valuable foundation for assessing mechanisms of signal transmission and for designing future experiments to elucidate factors involved in signal initiation, propagation, and target elicitation."
156,Recruitment of CRISPR-Cas systems by Tn7-like transposons,Microbiology,"CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immunity system that protects bacteria and archaea from mobile genetic elements. We present comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of minimal CRISPR-Cas variants associated with distinct families of transposable elements and develop the hypothesis that such repurposed defense systems contribute to the transposable element propagation by facilitating transposition into specific sites. Thus, these transposable elements are predicted to propagate via RNA-guided transposition, a mechanism that has not been previously described for DNA transposons.","A survey of bacterial and archaeal genomes shows that many Tn7-like transposons contain minimal type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems that consist of fused cas8f and cas5f, cas7f, and cas6f genes and a short CRISPR array. Several small groups of Tn7-like transposons encompass similarly truncated type I-B CRISPR-Cas. This minimal gene complement of the transposon-associated CRISPR-Cas systems implies that they are competent for pre-CRISPR RNA (precrRNA) processing yielding mature crRNAs and target binding but not target cleavage that is required for interference. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that evolution of the CRISPR-Cas–containing transposons included a single, ancestral capture of a type I-F locus and two independent instances of type I-B loci capture. We show that the transposon-associated CRISPR arrays contain spacers homologous to plasmid and temperate phage sequences and, in some cases, chromosomal sequences adjacent to the transposon. We hypothesize that the transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems generate displacement (R-loops) in the cognate DNA sites, targeting the transposon to these sites and thus facilitating their spread via plasmids and phages. These findings suggest the existence of RNA-guided transposition and fit the guns-for-hire concept whereby mobile genetic elements capture host defense systems and repurpose them for different stages in the life cycle of the element."
157,"Status threat, not economic hardship, explains the 2016 presidential vote",Political Sciences,"Support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election was widely attributed to citizens who were “left behind” economically. These claims were based on the strong cross-sectional relationship between Trump support and lacking a college education. Using a representative panel from 2012 to 2016, I find that change in financial wellbeing had little impact on candidate preference. Instead, changing preferences were related to changes in the party’s positions on issues related to American global dominance and the rise of a majority–minority America: issues that threaten white Americans’ sense of dominant group status. Results highlight the importance of looking beyond theories emphasizing changes in issue salience to better understand the meaning of election outcomes when public preferences and candidates’ positions are changing.","This study evaluates evidence pertaining to popular narratives explaining the American public’s support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. First, using unique representative probability samples of the American public, tracking the same individuals from 2012 to 2016, I examine the “left behind” thesis (that is, the theory that those who lost jobs or experienced stagnant wages due to the loss of manufacturing jobs punished the incumbent party for their economic misfortunes). Second, I consider the possibility that status threat felt by the dwindling proportion of traditionally high-status Americans (i.e., whites, Christians, and men) as well as by those who perceive America’s global dominance as threatened combined to increase support for the candidate who emphasized reestablishing status hierarchies of the past. Results do not support an interpretation of the election based on pocketbook economic concerns. Instead, the shorter relative distance of people’s own views from the Republican candidate on trade and China corresponded to greater mass support for Trump in 2016 relative to Mitt Romney in 2012. Candidate preferences in 2016 reflected increasing anxiety among high-status groups rather than complaints about past treatment among low-status groups. Both growing domestic racial diversity and globalization contributed to a sense that white Americans are under siege by these engines of change."
158,Microglia-derived extracellular vesicles trigger age-related neurodegeneration upon DNA damage,Genetics,"Neuroinflammation is a major risk factor for challenging neurodegenerative disorders. Our study shows that persistent DNA damage leads to the accumulation of cytosolic DNA fragments in microglia, stimulating a viral-like immune response in Er1Cx/− and naturally aged mouse brains. We found that microglia release cytosolic DNAs in extracellular vesicles, causing neuronal cell death. Building on these findings, we developed an anti-inflammatory approach to target activated brain microglia in vivo, eliminate cytosolic DNAs, and postpone the early onset of neurodegeneration.","DNA damage and neurodegenerative disorders are intimately linked but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that persistent DNA lesions in tissue-resident macrophages carrying an XPF-ERCC1 DNA repair defect trigger neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in mice. We find that microglia accumulate dsDNAs and chromatin fragments in the cytosol, which are sensed thereby stimulating a viral-like immune response in Er1Cx/− and naturally aged murine brain. Cytosolic DNAs are packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released from microglia and discharge their dsDNA cargo into IFN-responsive neurons triggering cell death. To remove cytosolic dsDNAs and prevent inflammation, we developed targeting EVs to deliver recombinant DNase I to Er1Cx/− brain microglia in vivo. We show that EV-mediated elimination of cytosolic dsDNAs is sufficient to prevent neuroinflammation, reduce neuronal apoptosis, and delay the onset of neurodegenerative symptoms in Er1Cx/− mice. Together, our findings unveil a causal mechanism leading to neuroinflammation and provide a rationalized therapeutic strategy against age-related neurodegeneration."
159,Green spaces and cognitive development in primary schoolchildren,Environmental Sciences,"Green spaces have a range of health benefits, but little is known in relation to cognitive development in children. This study, based on comprehensive characterization of outdoor surrounding greenness (at home, school, and during commuting) and repeated computerized cognitive tests in schoolchildren, found an improvement in cognitive development associated with surrounding greenness, particularly with greenness at schools. This association was partly mediated by reductions in air pollution. Our findings provide policymakers with evidence for feasible and achievable targeted interventions such as improving green spaces at schools to attain improvements in mental capital at population level.","Exposure to green space has been associated with better physical and mental health. Although this exposure could also influence cognitive development in children, available epidemiological evidence on such an impact is scarce. This study aimed to assess the association between exposure to green space and measures of cognitive development in primary schoolchildren. This study was based on 2,593 schoolchildren in the second to fourth grades (7–10 y) of 36 primary schools in Barcelona, Spain (2012–2013). Cognitive development was assessed as 12-mo change in developmental trajectory of working memory, superior working memory, and inattentiveness by using four repeated (every 3 mo) computerized cognitive tests for each outcome. We assessed exposure to green space by characterizing outdoor surrounding greenness at home and school and during commuting by using high-resolution (5 m × 5 m) satellite data on greenness (normalized difference vegetation index). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the associations between green spaces and cognitive development. We observed an enhanced 12-mo progress in working memory and superior working memory and a greater 12-mo reduction in inattentiveness associated with greenness within and surrounding school boundaries and with total surrounding greenness index (including greenness surrounding home, commuting route, and school). Adding a traffic-related air pollutant (elemental carbon) to models explained 20–65% of our estimated associations between school greenness and 12-mo cognitive development. Our study showed a beneficial association between exposure to green space and cognitive development among schoolchildren that was partly mediated by reduction in exposure to air pollution."
160,A cnidarian parasite of salmon (Myxozoa: Henneguya) lacks a mitochondrial genome,Evolution,"Mitochondrial respiration is an ancient characteristic of eukaryotes. However, it was lost independently in multiple eukaryotic lineages as part of adaptations to an anaerobic lifestyle. We show that a similar adaptation occurred in a member of the Myxozoa, a large group of microscopic parasitic animals that are closely related to jellyfish and hydroids. Using deep sequencing approaches supported by microscopic observations, we present evidence that an animal has lost its mitochondrial genome. The myxozoan cells retain structures deemed mitochondrion-related organelles, but have lost genes related to aerobic respiration and mitochondrial genome replication. Our discovery shows that aerobic respiration, one of the most important metabolic pathways, is not ubiquitous among animals.","Although aerobic respiration is a hallmark of eukaryotes, a few unicellular lineages, growing in hypoxic environments, have secondarily lost this ability. In the absence of oxygen, the mitochondria of these organisms have lost all or parts of their genomes and evolved into mitochondria-related organelles (MROs). There has been debate regarding the presence of MROs in animals. Using deep sequencing approaches, we discovered that a member of the Cnidaria, the myxozoan Henneguya salminicola, has no mitochondrial genome, and thus has lost the ability to perform aerobic cellular respiration. This indicates that these core eukaryotic features are not ubiquitous among animals. Our analyses suggest that H. salminicola lost not only its mitochondrial genome but also nearly all nuclear genes involved in transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome. In contrast, we identified many genes that encode proteins involved in other mitochondrial pathways and determined that genes involved in aerobic respiration or mitochondrial DNA replication were either absent or present only as pseudogenes. As a control, we used the same sequencing and annotation methods to show that a closely related myxozoan, Myxobolus squamalis, has a mitochondrial genome. The molecular results are supported by fluorescence micrographs, which show the presence of mitochondrial DNA in M. squamalis, but not in H. salminicola. Our discovery confirms that adaptation to an anaerobic environment is not unique to single-celled eukaryotes, but has also evolved in a multicellular, parasitic animal. Hence, H. salminicola provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism."
161,Membrane protein isolation and structure determination in cell-derived membrane vesicles,Biochemistry,"Structural studies of membrane proteins historically have relied almost exclusively on first removing membrane proteins from the membrane with dispersive agents like detergents. But dispersive agents destabilize many membrane proteins, and in all membrane proteins, they remove weakly associated lipids, cofactors, and proteins essential to normal biological function. The procedures presented in this paper allow structure determination at atomic resolution without ever removing the proteins from their membrane environment. Thus, the structures of proteins that heretofore could not be extracted stably from the membrane can now be analyzed, and weakly associated lipid molecules, cofactors, and proteins normally lost in isolation are retained. These methods have immediately become the approach of choice for membrane protein structure determination in our laboratory.","Integral membrane protein structure determination traditionally requires extraction from cell membranes using detergents or polymers. Here, we describe the isolation and structure determination of proteins in membrane vesicles derived directly from cells. Structures of the ion channel Slo1 from total cell membranes and from cell plasma membranes were determined at 3.8 Å and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. The plasma membrane environment stabilizes Slo1, revealing an alteration of global helical packing, polar lipid, and cholesterol interactions that stabilize previously unresolved regions of the channel and an additional ion binding site in the Ca2+ regulatory domain. The two methods presented enable structural analysis of both internal and plasma membrane proteins without disrupting weakly interacting proteins, lipids, and cofactors that are essential to biological function."
162,Learning the language of antibody hypervariability,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Antibodies are crucial in therapeutics and immune defense, but their hypervariable regions pose challenges for computational modeling. We introduce Antibody Mutagenesis-Augmented Processing (AbMAP), a transfer learning framework that adapts foundational protein language models to antibody-specific tasks. AbMAP focuses on the hypervariable regions, employing contrastive augmentation and multitask learning to capture both structural and functional properties. This approach significantly improves prediction accuracy for various antibody properties, including antigen binding and paratope identification. AbMAP demonstrates high efficiency in antibody optimization, achieving an 82% hit rate in refining SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies. Importantly, it unlocks large-scale analysis of immune repertoires, revealing surprising structural and functional convergence across individuals despite sequence diversity.","Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive success in modeling proteins. However, general-purpose “foundational” PLMs have limited performance in modeling antibodies due to the latter’s hypervariable regions, which do not conform to the evolutionary conservation principles that such models rely on. In this study, we propose a transfer learning framework called Antibody Mutagenesis-Augmented Processing (AbMAP), which fine-tunes foundational models for antibody-sequence inputs by supervising on antibody structure and binding specificity examples. Our learned feature representations accurately predict mutational effects on antigen binding, paratope identification, and other key antibody properties. We experimentally validate AbMAP for antibody optimization by applying it to refine a set of antibodies that bind to a SARS-CoV-2 peptide, and obtain an 82% hit-rate and up to 22-fold increase in binding affinity. AbMAP also unlocks large-scale analyses of immune repertoires, revealing that B-cell receptor repertoires of individuals, while remarkably different in sequence, converge toward similar structural and functional coverage. Importantly, AbMAP’s transfer learning approach can be readily adapted to advances in foundational PLMs. We anticipate AbMAP will accelerate the efficient design and modeling of antibodies, expedite the discovery of antibody-based therapeutics, and deepen our understanding of humoral immunity."
163,Long-chain alkanes preserved in a Martian mudstone,"Earth, Atmospheric, and planetary sciences","Decane, undecane, and dodecane were detected in a Martian sample at the tens of pmol level and may originate from long-chain carboxylic acids. The detection of long-chain alkanes in the Sheepbed mudstone is important for extending studies of habitability on Mars as the Curiosity rover continues to map out windows of high preservation potential for chemically reduced organic compounds. The provenance and distribution of these molecules are of high interest in the search for potential biosignatures on Mars.","Organic molecules preserved in ancient Martian rocks provide a critical record of the past habitability of Mars and could be chemical biosignatures. Experiments conducted by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument onboard the Curiosity rover have previously reported several classes of indigenous chlorinated and sulfur-containing organic compounds in Gale crater sedimentary rocks, with chemical structures of up to six carbons. Here, we report the detection of decane (C10H22), undecane (C11H24), and dodecane (C12H26) at the tens of pmol level, released from the Cumberland drilled mudstone sample, using a modified SAM analytical procedure optimized for the detection of larger organic molecules. Laboratory experiments support the hypothesis that the alkanes detected were originally preserved in the mudstone as long-chain carboxylic acids. The origin of these molecules remains uncertain, as they could be derived from either abiotic or biological sources."
164,Loss of lipid asymmetry facilitates plasma membrane blebbing by decreasing membrane lipid packing,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"The lipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane and its regulated release through lipid scrambling are critical determinants of membrane properties and functions. Such scrambling occurs during many biological events, including apoptosis, extracellular vesicle (EV) formation, sperm–egg fertilization, bone mineralization, viral infection, and blood coagulation. However, how lipid scrambling changes membrane properties that facilitate these events is currently unknown. This study reveals that loss of lipid asymmetry lowers membrane lipid packing, thereby facilitating the membrane deformation during blebbing. Our findings suggest that reducing lipid packing by lipid scrambling is an important contributor to the formation of EVs and potentially other cellular processes involving membrane deformation.","Membrane blebs have important roles in cell migration, apoptosis, and intercellular communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs). While plasma membranes (PM) typically maintain phosphatidylserine (PS) on their cytoplasmic leaflet, most blebs have PS exposed on their outer leaflet, revealing that loss of steady-state lipid asymmetry often accompanies PM blebbing. How these changes in PM lipid organization regulate membrane properties and affect bleb formation remains unknown. We confirmed that lipid scrambling through the scramblase TMEM16F is essential for chemically induced membrane blebbing across cell types, with the kinetics of PS exposure being tightly coupled to the kinetics of bleb formation. Measurement of lipid packing with environment-sensitive probes revealed that lipid scrambling changes the physical properties of the PM, reducing lipid packing and facilitating the bilayer bending required for bleb formation. Accordingly, reducing lipid packing of the PM through cholesterol extraction, elevated temperature, or treatment with biological amphiphiles promoted blebbing in the absence of TMEM16F. Consistent with these cellular observations, blebbing in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos measured via EV production was significantly reduced by depleting the TMEM16-homolog ANOH-2. Our findings suggest that changing membrane biophysical properties by lipid scrambling is an important contributor to the formation of blebs and EVs and potentially other cellular processes involving PM deformation."
165,International treaties have mostly failed to produce their intended effects,Political Sciences,"International treaties have mostly failed to produce their intended effects except for international trade and financial laws and treaties with enforcement mechanisms. These results are unexpected because they challenge conventional wisdom about treaties, which are widely considered as the apex mechanism for countries to make commitments to each other. Not only do our findings question the usefulness of the more than 250,000 existing treaties that have been negotiated to date but they should directly inform how national governments and international institutions facilitate global cooperation on the myriad challenges we face and how future international treaties can be better designed for greater impact.","There are over 250,000 international treaties that aim to foster global cooperation. But are treaties actually helpful for addressing global challenges? This systematic field-wide evidence synthesis of 224 primary studies and meta-analysis of the higher-quality 82 studies finds treaties have mostly failed to produce their intended effects. The only exceptions are treaties governing international trade and finance, which consistently produced intended effects. We also found evidence that impactful treaties achieve their effects through socialization and normative processes rather than longer-term legal processes and that enforcement mechanisms are the only modifiable treaty design choice with the potential to improve the effectiveness of treaties governing environmental, human rights, humanitarian, maritime, and security policy domains. This evidence synthesis raises doubts about the value of international treaties that neither regulate trade or finance nor contain enforcement mechanisms."
166,Proviral insights of glycolytic enolase in Bamboo mosaic virus replication associated with chloroplasts and mitochondria,Plant Biology,"Viruses are obligate parasites that often use internal membranous structures to create environments enriched with host factors, providing a protection environment for replication. Previous evidence shows that Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) hijacks nucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins for RNA targeting to chloroplasts and for subgenomic RNA transcription within chloroplasts. Moreover, it recruits several cytoplasmic proteins and mitochondria outer membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) into BaMV replication complex, which is essential for its replication. In this study, we identified pivotal role of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (ENO) in BaMV replication by maintaining ENO-VDAC metabolon, which depends on ENO structural integrity, and connects the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Our findings reveal that BaMV replication requires dynamic and sequential interactions between these two intracellular organelles.","Diverse single-stranded RNA viruses employ different host cellular organelles or membrane systems to compartmentalize their replication intermediates and proviral factors, ensuring robust replication. Replication of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), an Alphaflexiviridae family, is tightly associated with chloroplasts and dynamic cytosolic viral replication complex (VRC) clusters. BaMV VRC clusters comprise double-stranded viral RNA, BaMV replicase (RepBaMV), and mitochondrial outer membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). In this study, we demonstrate that host glycolytic enolase (ENO) binds to untranslated regions of BaMV RNA independently of ENO hydrolytic activity. However, the structural integrity of ENO is essential for its direct interaction with RepBaMV, and its positive regulating role in BaMV replication and the size of BaMV VRC clusters. Additionally, ENO, pyruvate kinase (PYK), and VDAC colocalize within cytosolic BaMV VRC clusters embedded in the convoluted endomembrane reticulum (ER) along with ER-targeted viral movement proteins under BaMV infection. This association suggests that the ENO-PYK-VDAC metabolon, with ENO serving as a scaffold to link chloroplasts and mitochondria, may play a pivotal role in BaMV robust replication. Collectively, our findings offer significant insights into how glycolytic ENO acts in BaMV replication."
167,Sea level and global ice volumes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene,"Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences","Several areas of earth science require knowledge of the fluctuations in sea level and ice volume through glacial cycles. These include understanding past ice sheets and providing boundary conditions for paleoclimate models, calibrating marine-sediment isotopic records, and providing the background signal for evaluating anthropogenic contributions to sea level. From ∼1,000 observations of sea level, allowing for isostatic and tectonic contributions, we have quantified the rise and fall in global ocean and ice volumes for the past 35,000 years. Of particular note is that during the ∼6,000 y up to the start of the recent rise ∼100−150 y ago, there is no evidence for global oscillations in sea level on time scales exceeding ∼200 y duration or 15−20 cm amplitude.","The major cause of sea-level change during ice ages is the exchange of water between ice and ocean and the planet’s dynamic response to the changing surface load. Inversion of ∼1,000 observations for the past 35,000 y from localities far from former ice margins has provided new constraints on the fluctuation of ice volume in this interval. Key results are: (i) a rapid final fall in global sea level of ∼40 m in <2,000 y at the onset of the glacial maximum ∼30,000 y before present (30 ka BP); (ii) a slow fall to −134 m from 29 to 21 ka BP with a maximum grounded ice volume of ∼52 × 106 km3 greater than today; (iii) after an initial short duration rapid rise and a short interval of near-constant sea level, the main phase of deglaciation occurred from ∼16.5 ka BP to ∼8.2 ka BP at an average rate of rise of 12 m⋅ka−1 punctuated by periods of greater, particularly at 14.5–14.0 ka BP at ≥40 mm⋅y−1 (MWP-1A), and lesser, from 12.5 to 11.5 ka BP (Younger Dryas), rates; (iv) no evidence for a global MWP-1B event at ∼11.3 ka BP; and (v) a progressive decrease in the rate of rise from 8.2 ka to ∼2.5 ka BP, after which ocean volumes remained nearly constant until the renewed sea-level rise at 100–150 y ago, with no evidence of oscillations exceeding ∼15–20 cm in time intervals ≥200 y from 6 to 0.15 ka BP."
168,Global estimates of mortality associated with long-term exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter,Environmental Sciences,"Exposure to outdoor concentrations of fine particulate matter is considered a leading global health concern, largely based on estimates of excess deaths using information integrating exposure and risk from several particle sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution and passive/active smoking). Such integration requires strong assumptions about equal toxicity per total inhaled dose. We relax these assumptions to build risk models examining exposure and risk information restricted to cohort studies of outdoor air pollution, now covering much of the global concentration range. Our estimates are severalfold larger than previous calculations, suggesting that outdoor particulate air pollution is an even more important population health risk factor than previously thought.","Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major global health concern. Quantitative estimates of attributable mortality are based on disease-specific hazard ratio models that incorporate risk information from multiple PM2.5 sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution from use of solid fuels and secondhand and active smoking), requiring assumptions about equivalent exposure and toxicity. We relax these contentious assumptions by constructing a PM2.5-mortality hazard ratio function based only on cohort studies of outdoor air pollution that covers the global exposure range. We modeled the shape of the association between PM2.5 and nonaccidental mortality using data from 41 cohorts from 16 countries—the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We then constructed GEMMs for five specific causes of death examined by the global burden of disease (GBD). The GEMM predicts 8.9 million [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.5–10.3] deaths in 2015, a figure 30% larger than that predicted by the sum of deaths among the five specific causes (6.9; 95% CI: 4.9–8.5) and 120% larger than the risk function used in the GBD (4.0; 95% CI: 3.3–4.8). Differences between the GEMM and GBD risk functions are larger for a 20% reduction in concentrations, with the GEMM predicting 220% higher excess deaths. These results suggest that PM2.5 exposure may be related to additional causes of death than the five considered by the GBD and that incorporation of risk information from other, nonoutdoor, particle sources leads to underestimation of disease burden, especially at higher concentrations."
169,Land use and climate change impacts on global soil erosion by water (2015-2070),Sustainability Science,"We use the latest projections of climate and land use change to assess potential global soil erosion rates by water to address policy questions; working toward the goals of the United Nations working groups under the Inter-Governmental Technical Panel on Soils of the Global Soil Partnership. This effort will enable policy makers to explore erosion extent, identify possible hotspots, and work with stakeholders to mitigate impacts. In addition, we provide insight into the potential mitigating effects attributable to conservation agriculture and the need for more effective policy instruments for soil protection. Scientifically, the modeling framework presented adopts a series of methodological advances and standardized data to communicate with adjacent disciplines and move toward robust, reproducible, and open data science.","Soil erosion is a major global soil degradation threat to land, freshwater, and oceans. Wind and water are the major drivers, with water erosion over land being the focus of this work; excluding gullying and river bank erosion. Improving knowledge of the probable future rates of soil erosion, accelerated by human activity, is important both for policy makers engaged in land use decision-making and for earth-system modelers seeking to reduce uncertainty on global predictions. Here we predict future rates of erosion by modeling change in potential global soil erosion by water using three alternative (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) Shared Socioeconomic Pathway and Representative Concentration Pathway (SSP-RCP) scenarios. Global predictions rely on a high spatial resolution Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE)-based semiempirical modeling approach (GloSEM). The baseline model (2015) predicts global potential soil erosion rates of 43^+9.2_-.7 Pg yr−1, with current conservation agriculture (CA) practices estimated to reduce this by ∼5%. Our future scenarios suggest that socioeconomic developments impacting land use will either decrease (SSP1-RCP2.6–10%) or increase (SSP2-RCP4.5 +2%, SSP5-RCP8.5 +10%) water erosion by 2070. Climate projections, for all global dynamics scenarios, indicate a trend, moving toward a more vigorous hydrological cycle, which could increase global water erosion (+30 to +66%). Accepting some degrees of uncertainty, our findings provide insights into how possible future socioeconomic development will affect soil erosion by water using a globally consistent approach. This preliminary evidence seeks to inform efforts such as those of the United Nations to assess global soil erosion and inform decision makers developing national strategies for soil conservation."
170,Live music stimulates the affective brain and emotionally entrains listeners in real time,Neuroscience,"Music is powerful in expressing and experiencing emotions, and affective neuroscience research used music to investigate brain mechanisms for processing auditory emotions. Previous research used recorded music to define a neural model for musical emotion processing, but the use of recorded music has limitations. Unlike recorded music, intense musical emotions are most often expressed in live musical performances and are experienced when listening to live music in concerts, given the dynamic relationship between performing artists and the audience. Here, we show that live music can stimulate the affective brain of listeners more strongly and consistently than recorded music. Live music also leads to dynamic music-brain couplings, including brain responses that are partly contrary to established neural models on musical emotions.","Music is powerful in conveying emotions and triggering affective brain mechanisms. Affective brain responses in previous studies were however rather inconsistent, potentially because of the non-adaptive nature of recorded music used so far. Live music instead can be dynamic and adaptive and is often modulated in response to audience feedback to maximize emotional responses in listeners. Here, we introduce a setup for studying emotional responses to live music in a closed-loop neurofeedback setup. This setup linked live performances by musicians to neural processing in listeners, with listeners’ amygdala activity was displayed to musicians in real time. Brain activity was measured using functional MRI, and especially amygdala activity was quantified in real time for the neurofeedback signal. Live pleasant and unpleasant piano music performed in response to amygdala neurofeedback from listeners was acoustically very different from comparable recorded music and elicited significantly higher and more consistent amygdala activity. Higher activity was also found in a broader neural network for emotion processing during live compared to recorded music. This finding included observations of the predominance for aversive coding in the ventral striatum while listening to unpleasant music, and involvement of the thalamic pulvinar nucleus, presumably for regulating attentional and cortical flow mechanisms. Live music also stimulated a dense functional neural network with the amygdala as a central node influencing other brain systems. Finally, only live music showed a strong and positive coupling between features of the musical performance and brain activity in listeners pointing to real-time and dynamic entrainment processes."
171,USP8-governed GPX4 homeostasis orchestrates ferroptosis and cancer immunotherapy,Cell Biology,"Ferroptosis is pivotal in various physiological and pathological processes, yet our understanding of its mechanisms and implications for tissue homeostasis and cancer immunotherapy remains incomplete. This study elucidates the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) in regulating lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in colon homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, we reveal that USP8 deubiquitinates glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), safeguarding it from proteasome-mediated degradation. Importantly, targeting the USP8-GPX4 axis enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in mouse tumor models, offering broad avenues for combinatorial therapeutic strategies in tumor immunotherapy.","Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent type of regulated cell death resulting from extensive lipid peroxidation and plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the regulatory mechanisms for ferroptosis sensitivity remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that homozygous deletion of Usp8 (ubiquitin-specific protease 8) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) leads to architectural changes in the colonic epithelium and shortens mouse lifespan accompanied by increased IEC death and signs of lipid peroxidation. However, mice with heterozygous deletion of Usp8 in IECs display normal phenotype and become resistant to azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate–induced colorectal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, USP8 interacts with and deubiquitinates glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), leading to GPX4 stabilization. Thus, USP8 inhibition destabilizes GPX4 and sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis in vitro. Notably, USP8 inhibition in combination with ferroptosis inducers retards tumor growth and enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration, which potentiates tumor response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in vivo. These findings uncover that USP8 counteracts ferroptosis by stabilizing GPX4 and highlight targeting USP8 as a potential therapeutic strategy to boost ferroptosis for enhancing cancer immunotherapy."
172,"Bacterial extracellular vesicles target different bacterial species, impairing cell division and diminishing their pathogenicity",Microbiology,"Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in host–bacteria and bacteria–bacteria interactions as delivery platforms or mediators. In bacterial communication, EVs have a dual function, being both cooperative and competitive. Here, we show that Escherichia coli EVs adhere to the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes and inhibit peptidoglycan (PG) remodeling, resulting in cell division defects and eventually growth inhibition. The finding that EVs target different bacterial species and may play a role in interspecies competition is important. Notably, the expression of numerous genes was altered in EV-treated bacteria, especially the repression of virulence genes, thereby diminishing pathogenicity. This highlights the potential of EVs to exploit the functional characteristics of EVs in the development of new antimicrobial agents.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by bacteria contain many bacterial-derived molecules, which play an important role in host interactions and as mediators of bacterial communication. However, the role of EVs in interspecies interactions and their physiological and ecological significance are not well understood. In this study, we found that Escherichia coli EVs inhibit the growth of group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) by inducing defective cell division via the following processes. E. coli EVs first attach to the cell surface of GAS. In EV-attached GAS cells, multiple septa and Z-rings form in close proximity, which clearly differs from the typical cell division process. This is due to inhibition of peptidoglycan (PG) remodeling in the process after septum formation, in which the next cell division is initiated without completion of peripheral PG synthesis. Therefore, cell division proceeds while inducing cell elongation and cell separation failure, leading to growth inhibition. Furthermore, EV alters the expression of approximately 10% of all genes encoded on the GAS genome, and the diverse functions of these gene sets, which include replication, division, and metabolism, suggest that EVs have a variety of biological effects on the targeted bacterial cells. Notably, E. coli EVs significantly decreased the expression of genes involved in representative GAS virulence, such as slo, nga, and hasA, and also markedly attenuated the pathogenicity of GAS in mice. Our findings provide insight into the competitive functions of EVs between different bacterial species, expanding current knowledge on EV-mediated interspecies interactions."
173,Delayed fungal evolution did not cause the Paleozoic peak in coal production,Environmental Sciences,"The Carboniferous−Permian marks the greatest coal-forming interval in Earth’s history, contributing to glaciation and uniquely high oxygen concentrations at the time and fueling the modern Industrial Revolution. This peak in coal deposition is frequently attributed to an evolutionary lag between plant synthesis of the recalcitrant biopolymer lignin and fungal capacities for lignin degradation, resulting in massive accumulation of plant debris. Here, we demonstrate that lignin was of secondary importance in many floras and that shifts in lignin abundance had no obvious impact on coal formation. Evidence for lignin degradation—including fungal—was ubiquitous, and absence of lignin decay would have profoundly disrupted the carbon cycle. Instead, coal accumulation patterns implicate a unique combination of climate and tectonics during Pangea formation.","Organic carbon burial plays a critical role in Earth systems, influencing atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations and, thereby, climate. The Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic is so named for massive, widespread coal deposits. A widely accepted explanation for this peak in coal production is a temporal lag between the evolution of abundant lignin production in woody plants and the subsequent evolution of lignin-degrading Agaricomycetes fungi, resulting in a period when vast amounts of lignin-rich plant material accumulated. Here, we reject this evolutionary lag hypothesis, based on assessment of phylogenomic, geochemical, paleontological, and stratigraphic evidence. Lignin-degrading Agaricomycetes may have been present before the Carboniferous, and lignin degradation was likely never restricted to them and their class II peroxidases, because lignin modification is known to occur via other enzymatic mechanisms in other fungal and bacterial lineages. Furthermore, a large proportion of Carboniferous coal horizons are dominated by unlignified lycopsid periderm with equivalent coal accumulation rates continuing through several transitions between floral dominance by lignin-poor lycopsids and lignin-rich tree ferns and seed plants. Thus, biochemical composition had little relevance to coal accumulation. Throughout the fossil record, evidence of decay is pervasive in all organic matter exposed subaerially during deposition, and high coal accumulation rates have continued to the present wherever environmental conditions permit. Rather than a consequence of a temporal decoupling of evolutionary innovations between fungi and plants, Paleozoic coal abundance was likely the result of a unique combination of everwet tropical conditions and extensive depositional systems during the assembly of Pangea."
174,Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates,Neuroscience,"Functional MRI (fMRI) is 25 years old, yet surprisingly its most common statistical methods have not been validated using real data. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from 499 healthy controls to conduct 3 million task group analyses. Using this null data with different experimental designs, we estimate the incidence of significant results. In theory, we should find 5% false positives (for a significance threshold of 5%), but instead we found that the most common software packages for fMRI analysis (SPM, FSL, AFNI) can result in false-positive rates of up to 70%. These results question the validity of a number of fMRI studies and may have a large impact on the interpretation of weakly significant neuroimaging results.","The most widely used task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses use parametric statistical methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging."
175,Changing personality traits with the help of a digital personality change intervention,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Personality traits have consequences and are malleable throughout the lifespan. However, it is unclear if and how personality traits can be changed in desired directions. A 3-mo digital personality change intervention was deployed, and a large-scale randomized controlled trial (n = 1,523) was conducted to examine the effects of intended personality change in a nonclinical sample. The intervention group showed greater changes than the control group, and changes aligned with intended goals for change. Observers also perceived personality changes, but reported changes were less pronounced. Moreover, self- and observer-reported changes persisted until 3 mo after the end of the intervention. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that normal personality traits can be changed through intervention in nonclinical samples.","Personality traits predict important life outcomes, such as success in love and work life, well-being, health, and longevity. Given these positive relations to important outcomes, economists, policy makers, and scientists have proposed intervening to change personality traits to promote positive life outcomes. However, nonclinical interventions to change personality traits are lacking so far in large-scale naturalistic populations. This study (n = 1,523) examined the effects of a 3-mo digital personality change intervention using a randomized controlled trial and the smartphone application PEACH (PErsonality coACH). Participants who received the intervention showed greater self-reported changes compared to participants in the waitlist control group who had to wait 1 mo before receiving the intervention. Self-reported changes aligned with intended goals for change and were significant for those desiring to increase on a trait (d = 0.52) and for those desiring to decrease on a trait (d = −0.58). Observers such as friends, family members, or intimate partners also detected significant personality changes in the desired direction for those desiring to increase on a trait (d = 0.35). Observer-reported changes for those desiring to decrease on a trait were not significant (d = −0.22). Moreover, self- and observer-reported changes persisted until 3 mo after the end of the intervention. This work provides the strongest evidence to date that normal personality traits can be changed through intervention in nonclinical samples."
176,Mind blanking is a distinct mental state linked to a recurrent brain profile of globally positive connectivity during ongoing mentation,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"The human mind is generally assumed to be constantly thinking. The phenomenology of mind blanking (MB) challenges this stance because it appears that we can be deprived of mental contents, or at least consciously preceiving them. We here show that, during spontaneous thinking, MB is a mental state that happens by default, it has a unique behavioral profile, and it is linked to a rigid neural architecture that does not permit us to report thoughts. This work corroborates that nonreportable mental events can happen during wakefulness, which challenges the view that the mind is constantly occupied by reportable thoughts.","Mind blanking (MB) is a waking state during which we do not report any mental content. The phenomenology of MB challenges the view of a constantly thinking mind. Here, we comprehensively characterize the MB’s neurobehavioral profile with the aim to delineate its role during ongoing mentation. Using functional MRI experience sampling, we show that the reportability of MB is less frequent, faster, and with lower transitional dynamics than other mental states, pointing to its role as a transient mental relay. Regarding its neural underpinnings, we observed higher global signal amplitude during MB reports, indicating a distinct physiological state. Using the time-varying functional connectome, we show that MB reports can be classified with high accuracy, suggesting that MB has a unique neural composition. Indeed, a pattern of global positive-phase coherence shows the highest similarity to the connectivity patterns associated with MB reports. We interpret this pattern’s rigid signal architecture as hindering content reportability due to the brain’s inability to differentiate signals in an informative way. Collectively, we show that MB has a unique neurobehavioral profile, indicating that nonreportable mental events can happen during wakefulness. Our results add to the characterization of spontaneous mentation and pave the way for more mechanistic investigations of MB’s phenomenology."
177,Distinguishing species boundaries from geographic variation,Evolution,"Species are often identified by gaps in their morphological and genetic diversity. However, the levels of differences that are typically observed between closely related species can also be observed between populations of geographically widespread species. We present and test a workflow to distinguish between intra- and interspecific diversity in a taxonomically complex group of frogs, and find that geographic variation has resulted in overdescription of species in 10 cases, but we also identify three new species that have been previously undescribed. We emphasize that explicit tests for gene flow among populations are required to test species hypotheses. Without positive evidence for reproductive isolation, the null hypothesis of any researcher should be variation within a single species.","In an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss, the need for standardized practices to describe biological variation is becoming increasingly important. As with all scientific endeavors, species delimitation needs to be explicit, testable, and refutable. A fundamental task in species delimitation is distinguishing within-species variation from among-species variation. Many species that are distributed across large geographic areas exhibit levels of genetic variation that are as great or greater than those that exist between well-defined sympatric species. Here, we provide a workflow to distinguish between intra- and interspecific genetic variation and apply the workflow to a taxonomically problematic group of frogs (the Rana pipiens complex, or leopard frogs) that are widely distributed across Mexico and Central America. Our workflow makes use of recent advancements that pair genome-scale datasets with model-based species delimitation methods, while emphasizing the need for positive evidence of reproductive isolation to confirm the validity of geographically contiguous species boundaries. We find that intraspecific geographic variation in widespread leopard frog species has resulted in considerable taxonomic inflation of species. Ten currently recognized species are not supported in our analyses, and we here synonymize them with previously named taxa. Furthermore, we find positive evidence for the presence of three undescribed species. In addition to proposing these taxonomic changes, we provide descriptions of the data or analyses that would be needed to refute and overturn our recommendations. We recommend that all species delimitation studies (especially of geographically variable groups) clarify what new evidence would be sufficient to change the taxonomic recommendations."
178,Efficient tagging of endogenous proteins in human cell lines for structural studies by single-particle cryo-EM,Biochemistry,"We present a versatile CRISPR/Cas strategy to insert affinity tags to endogenous proteins in human cell lines and demonstrated its efficiency by tagging human proteins in both HEK293T and Jurkat cells. Such efficient tagging extends the boundary of structural studies of human endogenous proteins. By tagging endogenous GAPDH in HEK293T cells, we demonstrate tracking its temporal and spatial structural changes in response to prolonged oxidative stress.","CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering has revolutionized our ability to manipulate biological systems, particularly in higher organisms. Here, we designed a set of homology-directed repair donor templates that enable efficient tagging of endogenous proteins with affinity tags by transient transfection and selection of genome-edited cells in various human cell lines. Combined with technological advancements in single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, this strategy allows efficient structural studies of endogenous proteins captured in their native cellular environment and during different cellular processes. We demonstrated this strategy by tagging six different human proteins in both HEK293T and Jurkat cells. Moreover, analysis of endogenous glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in HEK293T cells allowed us to follow its behavior spatially and temporally in response to prolonged oxidative stress, correlating the increased number of oxidation-induced inactive catalytic sites in GAPDH with its translocation from cytosol to nucleus."
179,Persistent pseudopod splitting is an effective chemotaxis strategy in shallow gradients,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Traditional cell-migration models assume that large nucleated cells navigate spatial chemical gradients by sensing differences across their entire length to move toward or away from a source. Our research challenges this view by demonstrating that cells can efficiently navigate using simple, local interactions within pseudopods-protrusions driven by actin polymerization from a finite monomeric actin pool and mutual inhibition. Employing deep reinforcement learning, we investigate how cells may have evolved to optimize their movement by selectively suppressing certain pseudopod growth directions, especially in shallow, difficult-to-sense gradients. This not only advances our understanding of cell behavior in fluctuating environments but also informs the development of bioinspired robots capable of navigation without complex sensory control and feedback mechanisms.","Single-cell organisms and various cell types use a range of motility modes when following a chemical gradient, but it is unclear which mode is best suited for different gradients. Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form de novo pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation."
180,The effects of Facebook and Instagram on the 2020 election: A deactivation experiment,Social Sciences,"We provide the largest-scale evidence available to date on the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in a presidential election season. This study is part of the U.S. 2020 Facebook and Instagram Election Study, a unique collaboration between academics and researchers at Meta that allowed unprecedented access to Meta platform data and algorithms while also including extensive safeguards to guarantee the integrity of the research.","We study the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political beliefs, attitudes, and behavior by randomizing a subset of 19,857 Facebook users and 15,585 Instagram users to deactivate their accounts for 6 wk before the 2020 U.S. election. We report four key findings. First, both Facebook and Instagram deactivation reduced an index of political participation (driven mainly by reduced participation online). Second, Facebook deactivation had no significant effect on an index of knowledge, but secondary analyses suggest that it reduced knowledge of general news while possibly also decreasing belief in misinformation circulating online. Third, Facebook deactivation may have reduced self-reported net votes for Trump, though this effect does not meet our preregistered significance threshold. Finally, the effects of both Facebook and Instagram deactivation on affective and issue polarization, perceived legitimacy of the election, candidate favorability, and voter turnout were all precisely estimated and close to zero."
181,"Compositional analysis of obsidian artifacts from the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan, capital of the Mexica (Aztec) Empire",Anthropology,"This study explores the use of obsidian at Tenochtitlan (c. 1375-1520 CE), identifying changes in the economic networks before and after the consolidation of the Mexica (Aztec) Empire (c. 1430 CE). The sample comprises 788 artifacts, one of the largest analyzed for Postclassic Mesoamerica, including multiple types of artifacts and contexts. Our results reveal the frequencies and variations of specific types of obsidian over time and the preference for a particular color and quality to produce ritual objects. Included in the obsidian assemblage are artifacts from outside of the boundaries of the Mexica Empire, such as Ucareo, the principal obsidian used by the Purépecha (Tarascan), implying that this raw material moved within different trade systems among rival polities","This study presents the results of geochemical compositional analysis through portable X-ray fluorescence of 788 artifacts from the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. The results reveal that the Mexica (Aztecs) preferred green obsidian from Sierra de Pachuca. However, a diachronic analysis (c. 1375-1520 CE) demonstrated that they continuously consumed obsidian from seven additional sources with some temporal variations related to the sociopolitical transformations of the empire. In the early phases, obsidian from Tulancingo, El Paraíso, and Zacualtipán is more common. After the consolidation of the Mexica Empire c.1430 CE, the patterns shifted to obsidian from Otumba, Paredón, and Ucareo. The study of artifacts from ritual and nonritual contexts demonstrates that most inhabitants used obsidian from multiple regions in the form of blades and flakes, probably acquired in local markets. Conversely, the elites and ritual specialists clearly preferred green obsidian from Pachuca to elaborate ritual objects due to its unique color and symbolic value. Ritual objects may arrive directly at the sacred precinct from the workshops outside the city, such as those found in Otumba and Pachuca. This study highlights the importance of analyzing large samples that combine ritual and nonritual artifacts, as well as objects from different phases, to explore temporal and social patterns of obsidian consumption among Pre-Hispanic societies."
182,Reevaluating the relationship between female sociality and infant survival in wild baboons,Anthropology,"In a variety of social animals, females who are more social are shown to have higher rates of infant survival compared to less social females. These associations have been interpreted as evidence that social relationships lead to increased offspring survival. Using long-term data on wild baboons, we demonstrate how these associations are affected by previously underappreciated confounds in maternal social data; specifically, by how females change their social behavior during different reproductive stages and when a live infant is present. After accounting for these confounds maternal sociality is no longer associated with enhanced infant survival in our dataset. These results mandate a closer scrutiny of the causal pathways linking maternal social behavior and infant survival in social mammals.","Over the past few decades, studies have provided strong evidence that the robust links between the social environment, health, and survival found in humans also extend to nonhuman social animals. A number of these studies emphasize the early life origins of these effects. For example, in several social mammals, more socially engaged mothers have infants with higher rates of survival compared to less socially engaged mothers, suggesting that positive maternal social relationships causally improve offspring survival. Here, we show that the relationship between infant survival and maternal sociality is confounded by previously underappreciated variation in female social behavior linked to changes in reproductive state and the presence of a live infant. Using data from a population of wild baboons living in the Amboseli basin of Kenya—a population where high levels of maternal sociality have previously been linked to improved infant survival—we find that infant- and reproductive state-dependent changes in female social behavior drive a statistically significant relationship between maternal sociality and infant survival. After accounting for these state-dependent changes in social behavior, maternal sociality is no longer positively associated with infant survival in this population. Our results emphasize the importance of considering multiple explanatory pathways—including third-variable effects—when studying the social determinants of health in wild populations."
183,How digital media drive affective polarization through partisan sorting,Social Sciences,"Recent years have seen a rapid rise of affective polarization, characterized by intense negative feelings between partisan groups. This represents a severe societal risk, threatening democratic institutions and constituting a metacrisis, reducing our capacity to respond to pressing societal challenges such as climate change, pandemics, or rising inequality. This paper provides a causal mechanism to explain this rise in polarization, by identifying how digital media may drive a sorting of differences, which has been linked to a breakdown of social cohesion and rising affective polarization. By outlining a potential causal link between digital media and affective polarization, the paper suggests ways of designing digital media so as to reduce their negative consequences.","Politics has in recent decades entered an era of intense polarization. Explanations have implicated digital media, with the so-called echo chamber remaining a dominant causal hypothesis despite growing challenge by empirical evidence. This paper suggests that this mounting evidence provides not only reason to reject the echo chamber hypothesis but also the foundation for an alternative causal mechanism. To propose such a mechanism, the paper draws on the literatures on affective polarization, digital media, and opinion dynamics. From the affective polarization literature, we follow the move from seeing polarization as diverging issue positions to rooted in sorting: an alignment of differences which is effectively dividing the electorate into two increasingly homogeneous megaparties. To explain the rise in sorting, the paper draws on opinion dynamics and digital media research to present a model which essentially turns the echo chamber on its head: it is not isolation from opposing views that drives polarization but precisely the fact that digital media bring us to interact outside our local bubble. When individuals interact locally, the outcome is a stable plural patchwork of cross-cutting conflicts. By encouraging nonlocal interaction, digital media drive an alignment of conflicts along partisan lines, thus effacing the counterbalancing effects of local heterogeneity. The result is polarization, even if individual interaction leads to convergence. The model thus suggests that digital media polarize through partisan sorting, creating a maelstrom in which more and more identities, beliefs, and cultural preferences become drawn into an all-encompassing societal division."
184,Shifting diets and the rise of male-biased inequality on the Central Plains of China during Eastern Zhou,Anthropology,"Male-biased inequality in Imperial China imposed strong limitations on the economic and intellectual contribution of women to the society and fostered male-biased resource distribution, because females were subordinated to the priorities of the patriarchal state. Analyzing human skeletal remains from early agricultural and later preimperial archaeological sites, we find no evidence of inequality between males and females in early farming communities. The observed differences between male and female skeletons from Eastern Zhou archaeological contexts allow us to infer a decline in female social status after the introduction of new crop plants and domesticated herbivores in preimperial China. The analysis reveals that male-biased inequality and subsistence change became intertwined with the rise of social complexity.","Farming domesticated millets, tending pigs, and hunting constituted the core of human subsistence strategies during Neolithic Yangshao (5000–2900 BC). Introduction of wheat and barley as well as the addition of domesticated herbivores during the Late Neolithic (∼2600–1900 BC) led to restructuring of ancient Chinese subsistence strategies. This study documents a dietary shift from indigenous millets to the newly introduced cereals in northcentral China during the Bronze Age Eastern Zhou Dynasty (771–221 BC) based on stable isotope analysis of human and animal bone samples. Our results show that this change affected females to a greater degree than males. We find that consumption of the newly introduced cereals was associated with less consumption of animal products and a higher rate of skeletal stress markers among females. We hypothesized that the observed separation of dietary signatures between males and females marks the rise of male-biased inequality in early China. We test this hypothesis by comparing Eastern Zhou human skeletal data with those from Neolithic Yangshao archaeological contexts. We find no evidence of male–female inequality in early farming communities. The presence of male-biased inequality in Eastern Zhou society is supported by increased body height difference between the sexes as well as the greater wealth of male burials."
185,Local exposure to school shootings and youth antidepressant use,Social Sciences,"In the last two decades, over 240,000 American students were on school grounds when a gunman opened fire at their school. While public attention often focuses on the victims who were killed, less is known about the impacts of school shootings on surviving youth. This study represents the largest analysis to date of the effects of school shootings on an important indicator of youth mental health: the use of prescription antidepressants. We find that local exposure to fatal school shootings leads to persistent and significant increases in youth antidepressant use. These impacts are smaller in areas with a higher density of mental health providers who focus on behavioral interventions.","While over 240,000 American students experienced a school shooting in the last two decades, little is known about the impacts of these events on the mental health of surviving youth. Using large-scale prescription data from 2006 to 2015, we examine the effects of 44 school shootings on youth antidepressant use. Our empirical strategy compares the number of antidepressant prescriptions written by providers practicing 0 to 5 miles from a school that experienced a shooting (treatment areas) to the number of prescriptions written by providers practicing 10 to 15 miles away (reference areas), both before and after the shooting. We include month-by-year and school-by-area fixed effects in all specifications, thereby controlling for overall trends in antidepressant use and all time-invariant differences across locations. We find that local exposure to fatal school shootings increases youth antidepressant use by 21.4% in the following 2 y. These effects are smaller in areas with a higher density of mental health providers who focus on behavioral, rather than pharmacological, interventions."
186,Observing many researchers using the same data and hypothesis reveals a hidden universe of uncertainty,Social Sciences,"Will different researchers converge on similar findings when analyzing the same data? Seventy-three independent research teams used identical cross-country survey data to test a prominent social science hypothesis: that more immigration will reduce public support for government provision of social policies. Instead of convergence, teams’ results varied greatly, ranging from large negative to large positive effects of immigration on social policy support. The choices made by the research teams in designing their statistical tests explain very little of this variation; a hidden universe of uncertainty remains. Considering this variation, scientists, especially those working with the complexities of human societies and behavior, should exercise humility and strive to better account for the uncertainty in their work.","This study explores how researchers’ analytical choices affect the reliability of scientific findings. Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers’ expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team’s workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers’ results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings."
187,"A 9,000-year-old caribou hunting structure beneath Lake Huron",Anthropology,"Some of the most pivotal questions in human history necessitate the investigation of archaeological sites that are now under water. These contexts have unique potentials for preserving ancient sites without disturbance from later human occupation. The Alpena-Amberley Ridge beneath modern Lake Huron in the Great Lakes offers unique evidence of prehistoric caribou hunters for a time period that is very poorly known on land. The newly discovered Drop 45 Drive Lane and associated artifacts presented here provide unprecedented insight into the social and seasonal organization of early peoples in the Great Lakes region, while the interdisciplinary research program provides a model for the archaeological investigation of submerged prehistoric landscapes.","Some of the most pivotal questions in human history necessitate the investigation of archaeological sites that are now under water. Nine thousand years ago, the Alpena-Amberley Ridge (AAR) beneath modern Lake Huron was a dry land corridor that connected northeast Michigan to southern Ontario. The newly discovered Drop 45 Drive Lane is the most complex hunting structure found to date beneath the Great Lakes. The site and its associated artifacts provide unprecedented insight into the social and seasonal organization of prehistoric caribou hunting. When combined with environmental and simulation studies, it is suggested that distinctly different seasonal strategies were used by early hunters on the AAR, with autumn hunting being carried out by small groups, and spring hunts being conducted by larger groups of cooperating hunters."
188,Group traits moderate the relationship between individual social traits and fitness in gorillas,Anthropology,"In humans, the social environment is one of the strongest predictors of health and lifespan. Similar patterns in other social mammals suggest that this is deeply rooted in our evolutionary history. Despite strong fitness benefits to sociality, individuals are far from consistent in their social tendencies, with many showing seemingly maladaptive traits. Here, we use data from a close evolutionary relative, mountain gorillas, to examine how social traits of individuals and their wider social group contribute to fitness. We show that the costs and benefits of individuals’ sociality are highly context dependent, differing between sexes and varying based on wider traits of their social groups. These findings can help explain why such a wide range of social traits are observed.","Evidence across a broad range of disciplines has demonstrated how individuals’ social environments can impact their health, lifespan, reproduction, and ultimately their evolutionary fitness. Past research has primarily focused on either traits specific to individuals or wider traits of social groups, linking these with a component of fitness. In this study, we examined how both individual- and group-level social traits in 164 wild mountain gorillas combine to influence multiple pathways impacting fitness over 21 y. First, we highlight key sex differences in the costs and benefits of social bonds, with strong and stable social bonds linked with lower risk of illness in females, but higher risk of illness in males. Second, we demonstrate important trade-offs in the fitness consequences of sociality, with strong and stable bonds in males linked with decreases in injury but increases in illness. Finally, we show the extensive moderating effects of group-level traits on the fitness consequences of individual-level social traits. For example, in small groups, females with strong bonds benefitted from lower rates of illness, but also showed lower birth rates, while in large groups, females with strong bonds experienced higher rates of illness but also higher birth rates. These findings highlight the complexity of selection acting on social traits, where the fitness consequences of individual’s social phenotypes are highly context dependent. We argue that this variability in the fitness benefits of sociality has likely played a fundamental role in maintaining the wide diversity of social phenotypes observed within species."
189,Embers of society: Firelight talk among the Ju/’hoansi Bushmen,Anthropology,"Control of fire and the capacity for cooking led to major anatomical and residential changes for early humans, starting more than a million years ago. However, little is known about what transpired when the day was extended by firelight. Data from the Ju/’hoan hunter-gatherers of southern Africa show major differences between day and night talk. Day talk centered on practicalities and sanctioning gossip; firelit activities centered on conversations that evoked the imagination, helped people remember and understand others in their external networks, healed rifts of the day, and conveyed information about cultural institutions that generate regularity of behavior and corresponding trust. Appetites for firelit settings for intimate conversations and for evening stories remain with us today.","Much attention has been focused on control of fire in human evolution and the impact of cooking on anatomy, social, and residential arrangements. However, little is known about what transpired when firelight extended the day, creating effective time for social activities that did not conflict with productive time for subsistence activities. Comparison of 174 day and nighttime conversations among the Ju/’hoan (!Kung) Bushmen of southern Africa, supplemented by 68 translated texts, suggests that day talk centers on economic matters and gossip to regulate social relations. Night activities steer away from tensions of the day to singing, dancing, religious ceremonies, and enthralling stories, often about known people. Such stories describe the workings of entire institutions in a small-scale society with little formal teaching. Night talk plays an important role in evoking higher orders of theory of mind via the imagination, conveying attributes of people in broad networks (virtual communities), and transmitting the “big picture” of cultural institutions that generate regularity of behavior, cooperation, and trust at the regional level. Findings from the Ju/’hoan are compared with other hunter-gatherer societies and related to the widespread human use of firelight for intimate conversation and our appetite for evening stories. The question is raised as to what happens when economically unproductive firelit time is turned to productive time by artificial lighting."
190,"Archaeobotanical evidence reveals the origins of bread 14,400 years ago in northeastern Jordan",Anthropology,"Despite being one of the most important foodstuffs consumed in the modern world, the origins of bread are still largely unknown. Here we report the earliest empirical evidence for the preparation of bread-like products by Natufian hunter-gatherers, 4,000 years before the emergence of the Neolithic agricultural way of life. The discovery of charred food remains has allowed for the reconstruction of the chaîne opératoire for the early production of bread-like products. Our results suggest the use of the wild ancestors of domesticated cereals (e.g. wild einkorn) and club-rush tubers to produce flat bread-like products. Cereal-based meals such as bread probably become staples when Neolithic farmers started to rely on the cultivation of domesticated cereal species for their subsistence.","The origins of bread have long been associated with the emergence of agriculture and cereal domestication during the Neolithic in southwest Asia. In this study we analyze a total of 24 charred food remains from Shubayqa 1, a Natufian hunter-gatherer site located in northeastern Jordan and dated to 14.6–11.6 ka cal BP. Our finds provide empirical data to demonstrate that the preparation and consumption of bread-like products predated the emergence of agriculture by at least 4,000 years. The interdisciplinary analyses indicate the use of some of the “founder crops” of southwest Asian agriculture (e.g., Triticum boeoticum, wild einkorn) and root foods (e.g., Bolboschoenus glaucus, club-rush tubers) to produce flat bread-like products. The available archaeobotanical evidence for the Natufian period indicates that cereal exploitation was not common during this time, and it is most likely that cereal-based meals like bread become staples only when agriculture was firmly established."
191,Learning loss due to school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic,Social Sciences,"School closures have been a common tool in the battle against COVID-19. Yet, their costs and benefits remain insufficiently known. We use a natural experiment that occurred as national examinations in The Netherlands took place before and after lockdown to evaluate the impact of school closures on students’ learning. The Netherlands is interesting as a “best-case” scenario, with a short lockdown, equitable school funding, and world-leading rates of broadband access. Despite favorable conditions, we find that students made little or no progress while learning from home. Learning loss was most pronounced among students from disadvantaged homes.","Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n  350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures."
192,Everyday challenges to women’s presence and authority yield greater burnout and less persistence in a male-dominated profession,Social Sciences,"We find evidence via a robust, longitudinal, multisite experience-sampling study in the high-status, male-dominated profession of surgery that women (compared to men) face more workplace experiences in which their professional role is challenged or their authority is questioned. In turn, the frequency of such experiences predicts, over time, increases in burnout and reduced plans to persist in the field. Whereas overt workplace discrimination against women has become less socially acceptable, more subtle forms of discrimination such as interpersonal mistreatment, which is simultaneously harder to identify but potentially more harmful to employee well-being, may persist. These findings have implications for women’s career opportunities, for burnout among health care providers, and for economies that need women’s labor participation to grow.","While most people believe that women (vs. men) experience more discriminatory treatment at work, especially in male-dominated professions, relatively few women report experiencing such treatment themselves. These low levels of reporting may arise either because discriminatory treatment has declined, even while laypeople’s assumptions of widespread discrimination persist, or because it is difficult for individuals to know when they are experiencing discriminatory treatment, leading to underreporting. In investigating this puzzle, we theorized four types of nonsexual workplace experiences that may target women and accumulate to harm well-being, yet may be difficult to recognize as discrimination. To test our predictions, we conducted a longitudinal, multisite experience-sampling study of surgeons, capturing workplace experiences over 5 mo. This approach addresses methodological limitations of past research, which include recall biases, demand characteristics, and low external validity. Consistent with hypotheses, female (vs. male) surgeons had more experiences in which their role was challenged or their authority questioned. Moreover, the frequency and severity of these experiences predicted increased burnout over time and decreased intentions to persist in surgery, regardless of whether participants attributed their experiences to their gender. Contrary to hypotheses, female surgeons did not encounter more presumptions of their helpfulness. Female surgeons also received more positive feedback, especially from other women, which yielded increases in professional efficacy and intentions to persist in surgery. Thus, while difficult to detect, workplace discriminatory treatment continues to harm women’s well-being and career opportunities, impede organizations’ efforts to recruit and retain women professionals, and exacerbate burnout among health care providers."
193,Simulating regional workforce impacts of decarbonizing integrated steelmaking,Social Sciences,"An insufficient understanding of the workforce implications of deep decarbonization may be limiting the pace of transition, especially in regions specialized in fossil fuel-intensive heavy industries. We introduce a generalizable methodology for assessing workforce implications of industrial decarbonization within regions that face a choice between shutting down or investing in low-carbon alternatives and apply it to integrated steelmaking in Southwest Pennsylvania. We estimate that decarbonized processes in iron and steelmaking will be far less labor intensive, requiring only a quarter of the jobs; among workers not transferred within industry (averaging 2,140 jobs per trial), we look to match occupations within the regional economy assuming near-term job growth projections. Production workers have the most limited transferability into the broader market.","Global efforts to mitigate climate change are increasing pressure on heavy manufacturing industries to decarbonize production. The iron and steel industry is responsible for 7% of CO2 emissions globally (2% in the United States) and is often a major employer in the regions where iron and steel is produced. Understanding the future prospects for workers in regions with high CO2 emitting industries—including impacts of phasing out or evolving such industries—will be critical for informing regional economic and clean energy strategies. We simulate the impact of an “in-place” transition that replaces today’s integrated production with direct reduced iron (DRI) used in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), using Southwest Pennsylvania as an application of our generalizable approach. Our results suggest that the integrated steelmaking workforce today has the skills, knowledge, and abilities (SKAs) to fill over 95% of all jobs required by DRI/EAF facilities, but the number of jobs is only 25% of those at integrated plants. We also find that some occupational groups have greater general transferability into the broader job market, while other groups, such as production workers, are ill-equipped today based on current SKAs to transition out of the iron and steel industry. Our methodology further suggests factors that limit transitions: Around 85% of occupations are more limited by missing skills, while 15% are more limited by insufficient wages. These results may help to improve the design of social policy and the targeting of retraining programs, while the simulation approach can be readily adapted for other regions and industries."
194,Measuring criticism of the police in the local news media using large language models,Social Sciences,"A large body of evidence documents political polarization in national reporting of divisive topics. This study examines this issue empirically for local media reporting using large language models. Our focus is coverage of the police. Contrary to public perception, we find no evidence of an increasing trend in critical reporting of the police over the past decade. While spikes in critical coverage coincide with high-profile national incidents of police killings, those spikes quickly return to the trendless baseline level. We also find little difference between the reporting in more conservative and more liberal cities. Taken as a whole, these results suggest local media coverage of the police has not succumbed to the partisanship that objective reporting aims to avoid.","High-profile incidents of police violence against Black citizens over the past decade have spawned contentious debates in the United States on the role of police. This debate has played out prominently in the news media, leading to a perception that media outlets have become more critical of the police. There is currently, however, little empirical evidence supporting this perceived shift. We construct a large dataset of local news reporting on the police from 2013 to 2023 in 10 politically diverse U.S. cities. Leveraging advanced language models, we measure criticism by analyzing whether reporting supports or is critical of two contentions: 1) that the police protect citizens and 2) that the police are racist. To validate this approach, we collect labels from members of different political parties. We find that contrary to public perceptions, local media criticism of the police has remained relatively stable along these two dimensions over the past decade. While criticism spiked in the aftermath of high-profile police killings, such as George Floyd’s murder, these events did not produce sustained increases in negative police news. In fact, reporting supportive of police effectiveness has increased slightly since Floyd’s death. We find only small differences in coverage trends in more conservative and more liberal cities, undermining the idea that local outlets cater to the politics of their audiences. Last, although Republicans are more likely to view a piece of news as supportive of the police than Democrats, readers across parties see reporting as no more critical than it was a decade ago."
195,Peer income exposure across the income distribution,Social Sciences,"Our study provides a comprehensive description of the income of students’ school and classroom peers. Although schools have the potential to expose students to diverse peers, our data show substantial income segregation in schools and classrooms. We find that the high-income students are exposed to a particularly skewed set of peers, and that the highest-income students have 20 percent of their peers coming from the top five income percentiles. The uneven distribution of students is largely due to sorting across schools rather than within schools, with the relative contribution of between-school sorting being higher in elementary school than middle and high school.","Children from families across the income distribution attend public schools, making schools and classrooms potential sites for interaction between more- and less-affluent children. However, limited information exists regarding the extent of economic integration in these contexts. We merge educational administrative data from Oregon with measures of family income derived from IRS records to document student exposure to economically diverse school and classroom peers. Our findings indicate that affluent children in public schools are relatively isolated from their less affluent peers, while low- and middle-income students experience relatively even peer income distributions. Students from families in the top percentile of the income distribution attend schools where 20 percent of their peers, on average, come from the top five income percentiles. A large majority of the differences in peer exposure that we observe arise from the sorting of students across schools; sorting across classrooms within schools plays a substantially smaller role."
196,Black and Latinx workers reap lower rewards than White workers from years spent working in big cities,Social Sciences,"Bigger cities are widely agreed to generally provide greater career-long learning opportunities for workers than smaller cities. However, recent research also shows that racial inequality in wages tends to be higher in larger cities. In this research, we show that this greater disparity in bigger cities builds over time, as White workers are rewarded more than Black and Latinx workers for the experience acquisition advantages that big cities provide. This is true even when such workers have similar starting skills and enter the same occupations. Our results thus suggest that reducing racial economic inequality in big cities may require both equalizing initial access to education and highly rewarded occupations as well as rewarding career-long work experience equally.","The large labor markets of big cities offer greater possibilities for workers to gain skills and experience through successively better employment opportunities. This “experience effect” contributes to the higher average wages that are found in big cities compared to the economy as a whole. Racial wage inequality is also higher in bigger cities than in the economy on average. We offer an explanation for this pattern, demonstrating that there is substantial racial inequality in the economic returns to work experience acquired in big cities. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 we find that each year of work experience in a big city increases Black and Latinx workers’ wages by about one quarter to half as much as White workers’ wages. A substantial amount of this inequality can be explained by further racial disparities in the benefits of high-skill work experience. This research identifies a heretofore unknown source of inequality that is distinctly urban in nature, and expands our knowledge of the challenges to reaching interracial wage equality."
197,Vulnerability to natural disasters and sustainable consumption: Unraveling political and regional differences,Social Sciences,"Climate change beliefs are often highly polarized, with leftists exhibiting more proenvironmental attitudes than rightists. However, our analysis of secondary data shows that greater vulnerability to natural disasters increases sustainable consumption intentions for rightists but not necessarily for leftists. Importantly, we observe this pattern not only in the United States but also in Western Europe and Israel. In contrast, in Central and Eastern Europe, vulnerability to natural disasters does not differentially influence sustainable consumption intentions of leftists and rightists. This may be due to the lack of an association between political ideology and climate change beliefs in this region. Additionally, our quasiexperiment suggests that highlighting recent natural disasters in one’s locality encourages rightists to purchase sustainable alternatives to everyday products.","The urgent calls for action on climate change underscore the importance of increasing sustainable behavior among individuals who have traditionally veered away from it, such as those on the political right. Utilizing data from four geopolitical regions across 24 countries, we explore whether vulnerability to natural disasters, brought on by either experiencing or anticipating a natural disaster, is a crucial factor. We find that as vulnerability to natural disasters increases, sustainable consumption intentions significantly increase among rightists in Western Europe, Israel, and the United States. Environmental motives, rather than economic or trend motives, are found to drive this effect. This suggests that, for rightists, the expectation of being directly impacted by climate change can override their established attitudes and foster more sustainable behavior with the goal of helping the environment. In contrast, the same increase in sustainable consumption intentions is weaker among leftists, who already embrace sustainable behavior. Interestingly, in Central and Eastern Europe, this interplay between political ideology and vulnerability to natural disasters is absent, highlighting the unique postcommunist context of this region. These findings underscore the necessity of tailored strategies for promoting sustainable behavior across regional contexts and provide vital insight into how sustainable consumption may increase among groups that have traditionally resisted it. In a quasiexperiment, we test the potential of an intervention using messages that highlight recent natural disasters in one’s locality and demonstrate its effectiveness in pushing rightists toward sustainable consumption."
198,The effect of job loss on risky financial decision-making,Social Sciences,"Few life events are as detrimental to a person’s well-being as job loss. It has a substantial effect on spending, mental and physical health, and behavior. However, less is known about its impact on decision making outcomes like risk-taking. We focus on job loss and risk-taking behavior, using a multimethods approach presenting correlational evidence from survey data, and causal evidence from administrative data on gambling spending from a large bank and an online lab experiment. Job loss shifts decision making toward more risky financial decisions. This tendency to take more financial risk could accentuate the negative outcomes associated with job loss.","Job loss is a common and disruptive life event. It is known to have numerous long-term negative effects on financial, health, and social outcomes. While the negative effects of becoming unemployed on health and well-being are well understood, the influence of job loss on financial decisions has received little attention. Across a large-scale survey (N = 37,854), spending data from a bank (N = 404,470), and two online experiments (total N = 1,403), we find that job loss increases financial risk-taking. First, in survey data, job loss is associated with elevated levels of self-reported financial risk-taking and lottery ticket purchases. Next, using administrative data from a large bank, we find consistent causal evidence of the influence of job loss on gambling spending. Although total spending decreases after job loss, gambling spending is less affected than our control categories. Finally, we turn to two incentive-compatible manipulations of job loss operationalized in a lab setting. We find that this experimental manipulation increases the take-up of financial risks. The current finding that job loss increases financial risk-taking could accentuate long-term negative financial effects of job loss."
199,The long-term impact of debt relief for indigent defendants in a misdemeanor court,Social Sciences,"Fines and fees, assessed on criminal defendants for a wide variety of legal operations, are common in US courts. A randomized experiment in a misdemeanor court shows relief from fines and fees reduced incarceration, arrest warrants, and debt collection activity over 44 mo of follow-up. Instead of ensuring accountability or deterring crime, fines and fees prolonged court involvement for those who are often too poor to pay.","US courts regularly assess fines, fees, and costs against criminal defendants. Court-related debt can cause continuing court involvement and incarceration, not because of new crimes, but because of unpaid financial obligations. We conducted an experiment with 606 people found guilty of misdemeanors in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Study participants were randomly selected to receive relief from all current and prior fines and fees assessed for criminal charges in the county. Fee relief reduced jail bookings 21 mo after randomization and the effect persisted over 44 mo of follow-up. Although fee relief reduced incarceration, financial sanctions had no effect on indicators of lawbreaking. Instead, the control group (who obtained no relief from fines and fees) were rearrested at significantly higher rates because of open arrest warrants for nonpayment. These results indicate the long-term and criminalizing effects of legal debt, supporting claims that financial sanctions disproportionately harm low-income defendants while contributing little to public safety."
200,"Early evidence of avocado domestication from El Gigante Rockshelter, Honduras",Anthropology,"Avocado farming is a multibillion-dollar industry of global significance, but the avocado’s domestication history remains unclear. Wild avocados occur throughout the subtropics and neotropics from Mexico to South America and genetic studies suggest at least three independent episodes of domestication within this range. Well-dated archaeological avocado remains required to evaluate the complexities of the domestication process are scarce. Using an unparalleled sequence of radiocarbon-dated avocado remains we define a location of domestication in western Honduras, demonstrating a protracted process of arboriculture and selection for larger, more robust fruits during the last 11,000 y. An emphasis on arboriculture preceded heavy reliance upon staple grain cultivation, contrary to observations in Asia where tree domestication occurred well after annual crops were established.","Molecular research suggests that avocados (Persea americana Mill.) were domesticated multiple times in the Americas. Seed exchange, hybridization, and cloning have played an essential role across their wild distribution from Mexico to South America to create the modern varieties of today. Archaeological sites with well-preserved and directly radiocarbon-dated botanical assemblages are rare, however, so we know very little about the complexities of the domestication process. Here, we define an early locus of avocado domestication using well-dated desiccated and carbonized avocado remains from El Gigante rockshelter in western Honduras spanning the last 11,000 y. Measurements of avocado seeds and rinds show evidence for long-term management resulting in selection for larger, more robust fruits through time that culminated by 2,250 to 2,080 calendar B.P. (cal. B.P.). However, human-directed selection for larger fruits with thicker rinds is evident as early as 7,565 to 7,265 cal. B.P. Seed morphology is similar to P. americana var. guatemalensis and is congruent with genetic data for the development of this variety in both the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. Increases in seed size and rind thickness through time are consistent with genetic evidence for the enrichment of putative candidate genes for fruit development and ripening in this variety."
201,Elevated extinction risk in over one-fifth of native North American pollinators,Ecology,"Pollinators are critical to maintaining terrestrial ecosystem function and the global food supply, but many are in decline. However, we have limited information identifying which species are at elevated extinction risk, limiting efforts to prioritize scarce conservation resources. We assessed the extinction risk of nearly 1,600 species of vertebrate and insect pollinators and found that more than one in five species is at risk of extinction. The major threats are climate change, agriculture, modifications to hydrological and fire regimes, and housing and urban development. These results can inform management actions to help prevent pollinator extinctions.","Pollinators are critical to maintaining terrestrial ecosystem function and the global food supply, but many are in decline.

202,Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates,Neuroscience,"Functional MRI (fMRI) is 25 years old, yet surprisingly its most common statistical methods have not been validated using real data. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from 499 healthy controls to conduct 3 million task group analyses. Using this null data with different experimental designs, we estimate the incidence of significant results. In theory, we should find 5% false positives (for a significance threshold of 5%), but instead we found that the most common software packages for fMRI analysis (SPM, FSL, AFNI) can result in false-positive rates of up to 70%. These results question the validity of a number of fMRI studies and may have a large impact on the interpretation of weakly significant neuroimaging results.","The most widely used task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses use parametric statistical methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging."
203,A cnidarian parasite of salmon (Myxozoa: Henneguya) lacks a mitochondrial genome,Evolution,"Mitochondrial respiration is an ancient characteristic of eukaryotes. However, it was lost independently in multiple eukaryotic lineages as part of adaptations to an anaerobic lifestyle. We show that a similar adaptation occurred in a member of the Myxozoa, a large group of microscopic parasitic animals that are closely related to jellyfish and hydroids. Using deep sequencing approaches supported by microscopic observations, we present evidence that an animal has lost its mitochondrial genome. The myxozoan cells retain structures deemed mitochondrion-related organelles, but have lost genes related to aerobic respiration and mitochondrial genome replication. Our discovery shows that aerobic respiration, one of the most important metabolic pathways, is not ubiquitous among animals.","Although aerobic respiration is a hallmark of eukaryotes, a few unicellular lineages, growing in hypoxic environments, have secondarily lost this ability. In the absence of oxygen, the mitochondria of these organisms have lost all or parts of their genomes and evolved into mitochondria-related organelles (MROs). There has been debate regarding the presence of MROs in animals. Using deep sequencing approaches, we discovered that a member of the Cnidaria, the myxozoan Henneguya salminicola, has no mitochondrial genome, and thus has lost the ability to perform aerobic cellular respiration. This indicates that these core eukaryotic features are not ubiquitous among animals. Our analyses suggest that H. salminicola lost not only its mitochondrial genome but also nearly all nuclear genes involved in transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome. In contrast, we identified many genes that encode proteins involved in other mitochondrial pathways and determined that genes involved in aerobic respiration or mitochondrial DNA replication were either absent or present only as pseudogenes. As a control, we used the same sequencing and annotation methods to show that a closely related myxozoan, Myxobolus squamalis, has a mitochondrial genome. The molecular results are supported by fluorescence micrographs, which show the presence of mitochondrial DNA in M. squamalis, but not in H. salminicola. Our discovery confirms that adaptation to an anaerobic environment is not unique to single-celled eukaryotes, but has also evolved in a multicellular, parasitic animal. Hence, H. salminicola provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism."
204,Reduced thermal tolerance in a coral carrying CRISPR-induced mutations in the gene for a heat-shock transcription factor,Genetics,"Coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots of great ecological, economic, and aesthetic importance. Their global decline due to climate change and other stressors has increased the urgency of understanding the molecular bases of corals’ responses to stress. Analyses of coral genomes and gene-expression patterns have identified many genes that may be important in stress resistance, but rigorous testing of their function will require the analysis of appropriate mutants. Here, we used CRISPR technology to show that mutational loss of a putative regulator of gene expression in response to heat stress indeed produced a loss of heat tolerance. Such use of CRISPR to generate mutations in corals should illuminate many aspects of coral biology and, thus, help to guide conservation efforts.","Reef-building corals are keystone species that are threatened by anthropogenic stresses including climate change. To investigate corals’ responses to stress and other aspects of their biology, numerous genomic and transcriptomic studies have been performed, generating many hypotheses about the roles of particular genes and molecular pathways. However, it has not generally been possible to test these hypotheses rigorously because of the lack of genetic tools for corals or closely related cnidarians. CRISPR technology seems likely to alleviate this problem. Indeed, we show here that microinjection of single-guide RNA/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes into fertilized eggs of the coral Acropora millepora can produce a sufficiently high frequency of mutations to detect a clear phenotype in the injected generation. Based in part on experiments in a sea-anemone model system, we targeted the gene encoding Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) and obtained larvae in which >90% of the gene copies were mutant. The mutant larvae survived well at 27 °C but died rapidly at 34 °C, a temperature that did not produce detectable mortality over the duration of the experiment in wild-type (WT) larvae or larvae injected with Cas9 alone. We conclude that HSF1 function (presumably its induction of genes in response to heat stress) plays an important protective role in corals. More broadly, we conclude that CRISPR mutagenesis in corals should allow wide-ranging and rigorous tests of gene function in both larval and adult corals."
205,Estrogens influence female itch sensitivity via the spinal gastrin-releasing peptide receptor neurons,Neuroscience,"Many women exhibit a dramatic increase in itch during pregnancy, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the female sex steroid hormone estradiol, but not progesterone, enhances itch-related scratching behavior in female rats elicited by histamine, the prototypical itch mediator in humans. This is associated with an enhancement in histamine-evoked activity of a subset of spinal dorsal horn neurons that express a neuropeptide receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), that was previously shown to be involved in spinal cord processing of itch. These findings may account for why itch sensation varies with estrogen levels and provide a basis for treating histamine-related itch diseases in females by targeting GRPR.","There are sex differences in somatosensory sensitivity. Circulating estrogens appear to have a pronociceptive effect that explains why females are reported to be more sensitive to pain than males. Although itch symptoms develop during pregnancy in many women, the underlying mechanism of female-specific pruritus is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that estradiol, but not progesterone, enhances histamine-evoked scratching behavior indicative of itch in female rats. Estradiol increased the expression of the spinal itch mediator, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and increased the histamine-evoked activity of itch-processing neurons that express the GRP receptor (GRPR) in the spinal dorsal horn. The enhancement of itch behavior by estradiol was suppressed by intrathecal administration of a GRPR blocker. In vivo electrophysiological analysis showed that estradiol increased the histamine-evoked firing frequency and prolonged the response of spinal GRP-sensitive neurons in female rats. On the other hand, estradiol did not affect the threshold of noxious thermal pain and decreased touch sensitivity, indicating that estradiol separately affects itch, pain, and touch modalities. Thus, estrogens selectively enhance histamine-evoked itch in females via the spinal GRP/GRPR system. This may explain why itch sensation varies with estrogen levels and provides a basis for treating itch in females by targeting GRPR."
206,How digital media drive affective polarization through partisan sorting,Social Sciences,"Recent years have seen a rapid rise of affective polarization, characterized by intense negative feelings between partisan groups. This represents a severe societal risk, threatening democratic institutions and constituting a metacrisis, reducing our capacity to respond to pressing societal challenges such as climate change, pandemics, or rising inequality. This paper provides a causal mechanism to explain this rise in polarization, by identifying how digital media may drive a sorting of differences, which has been linked to a breakdown of social cohesion and rising affective polarization. By outlining a potential causal link between digital media and affective polarization, the paper suggests ways of designing digital media so as to reduce their negative consequences.","Politics has in recent decades entered an era of intense polarization. Explanations have implicated digital media, with the so-called echo chamber remaining a dominant causal hypothesis despite growing challenge by empirical evidence. This paper suggests that this mounting evidence provides not only reason to reject the echo chamber hypothesis but also the foundation for an alternative causal mechanism. To propose such a mechanism, the paper draws on the literatures on affective polarization, digital media, and opinion dynamics. From the affective polarization literature, we follow the move from seeing polarization as diverging issue positions to rooted in sorting: an alignment of differences which is effectively dividing the electorate into two increasingly homogeneous megaparties. To explain the rise in sorting, the paper draws on opinion dynamics and digital media research to present a model which essentially turns the echo chamber on its head: it is not isolation from opposing views that drives polarization but precisely the fact that digital media bring us to interact outside our local bubble. When individuals interact locally, the outcome is a stable plural patchwork of cross-cutting conflicts. By encouraging nonlocal interaction, digital media drive an alignment of conflicts along partisan lines, thus effacing the counterbalancing effects of local heterogeneity. The result is polarization, even if individual interaction leads to convergence. The model thus suggests that digital media polarize through partisan sorting, creating a maelstrom in which more and more identities, beliefs, and cultural preferences become drawn into an all-encompassing societal division."
207,Psychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology,Cell Biology,"Psychosocial experiences predict health trajectories, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We report that positive psychosocial experiences are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial energy transformation machinery, whereas negative experiences are linked to lower abundance. Overall, psychosocial experiences accounted for 18 to 25% of the variance in protein abundance for complex I, the largest and most upstream mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) enzyme. At single-cell resolution, positive psychosocial experiences were particularly related to glial cell mitochondrial phenotypes. As a result, opposite associations between glial cells and neurons were naturally masked in bulk transcriptomic analyses. Our results suggest that mitochondrial recalibrations in specific brain cell types may represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking psychosocial experiences to human brain health.","Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these “mind-mitochondria” associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes."
208,Bone microstructure supports a Mesozoic origin for a semiaquatic burrowing lifestyle in monotremes (Mammalia),Evolution,"The egg-laying monotremes have played a central role in our understanding of mammalian evolution, but their fossil record is poor and their evolutionary history is controversial. Living monotremes are ecologically very distinct from each other: The platypus is well adapted for a semiaquatic lifestyle, whereas echidnas are fully terrestrial. Here, we show that an isolated mammal humerus from the Early Cretaceous of Australia, from a species called Kryoryctes cadburyi, belongs to a monotreme, and that microscopic features of this bone indicate that this monotreme was a semiaquatic burrower. This suggests that the amphibious lifestyle of the modern platypus had its origins at least 100 Mya, during the Age of Dinosaurs, and that echidnas evolved from semiaquatic ancestors.","The platypus and four echidna species are the only living egg-laying mammals and the sole extant representatives of Order Monotremata. The platypus and echidnas are very disparate both morphologically and ecologically: The platypus is a specialized semiaquatic burrowing form that forages for freshwater invertebrates, whereas echidnas are fully terrestrial and adapted for feeding on social insects and earthworms. It has been proposed that echidnas evolved from a semiaquatic, platypus-like ancestor, but fossil evidence for such a profound evolutionary transformation has been lacking, and this hypothesis remains controversial. Here, we present original data about the Early Cretaceous (108 to 103 Ma) Australian mammal Kryoryctes cadburyi, currently only known from a single humerus, that provides key information relating to this question. Phylogenetic analysis of a 536-character morphological matrix of mammaliaforms places Kryoryctes as a stem-monotreme. Three-dimensional whole bone comparisons show that the overall shape of the humerus is more similar to that of echidnas than the platypus, but analysis of microstructure reveals specializations found in semiaquatic mammals, including a particularly thick cortex and a highly reduced medullary cavity, present in the platypus but absent in echidnas. The evidence suggests Kryoryctes was a semiaquatic burrower, indicating that monotremes first evolved an amphibious lifestyle in the Mesozoic, and providing support for the hypothesis that this is ancestral for living monotremes as a whole. The lineage leading to the modern platypus appears to have been characterized by extremely long term (>100 My) niche conservatism, with echidnas representing a much later reversion to a fully terrestrial lifestyle."
209,A global estimate of multiecosystem photosynthesis losses under microplastic pollution,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Our study presents a global assessment of microplastic pollution’s impact on food security. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 3,286 records, we quantify the reduction in photosynthesis caused by microplastics across various ecosystems. This reduction is estimated to cause an annual loss of 109.73 to 360.87 million metric tons (MT) for crop production and 1.05 to 24.33 MT for seafood production. By reducing current environmental microplastic levels by 13%, these losses could be mitigated by 14.26 to 46.91 MT in crops and 0.14 to 3.16 MT in seafood. These findings underscore the urgency for effective plastic mitigation strategies and provide insights for international researchers and policymakers to safeguard global food supplies in the face of the growing plastic crisis.","Understanding how ecosystems respond to ubiquitous microplastic (MP) pollution is crucial for ensuring global food security. Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y−1) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y−1) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y−1 in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y−1 in seafood production. These findings underscore the urgency of integrating plastic mitigation into global hunger and sustainability initiatives."
210,The European Union Emissions Trading System reduced CO2 emissions despite low prices,Environmental Sciences,"International carbon markets are an appealing and increasingly popular tool to regulate carbon emissions. They put a price on carbon emissions and make pollution less attractive for regulated firms. However, carbon markets often produce prices which are deemed too low relative to the social cost of carbon. We argue that despite low prices, carbon markets can help reduce emissions. Using a statistical model and sectoral emissions data, we find that the EU ETS, which initially regulated roughly 50% of EU carbon emissions from mainly energy production and large industrial polluters, saved more than 1 billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016. This translates to reductions of 3.8% of total EU-wide emissions compared to a world without the EU ETS.","International carbon markets are an appealing and increasingly popular tool to regulate carbon emissions. By putting a price on carbon, carbon markets reshape incentives faced by firms and reduce the value of emissions. How effective are carbon markets? Observers have tended to infer their effectiveness from market prices. The general belief is that a carbon market needs a high price in order to reduce emissions. As a result, many observers remain skeptical of initiatives such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), whose price remained low (compared to the social cost of carbon). In this paper, we assess whether the EU ETS reduced  emissions despite low prices. We motivate our study by documenting that a carbon market can be effective if it is a credible institution that can plausibly become more stringent in the future. In such a case, firms might cut emissions even though market prices are low. In fact, low prices can be a signal that the demand for carbon permits weakens. Thus, low prices are compatible with successful carbon markets. To assess whether the EU ETS reduced carbon emissions even as permits were cheap, we estimate counterfactual carbon emissions using an original sectoral emissions dataset. We find that the EU ETS saved about 1.2 billion tons of  between 2008 and 2016 (3.8%) relative to a world without carbon markets, or almost half of what EU governments promised to reduce under their Kyoto Protocol commitments. Emission reductions in sectors covered under the EU ETS were higher."
211,AlphaFold-Multimer accurately captures interactions and dynamics of intrinsically disordered protein regions,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"The contribution of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) to cellular processes often hinges on their exquisite interaction versatility. The question arises whether complexity of IDR interactions can be captured by AI-based structure prediction methods primarily trained on independently folding domains. We demonstrate the capability of AlphaFold-Multimer to accurately predict structures adopted by IDRs upon binding. Although predictions are less successful for IDRs that interact in more heterogeneous manners, AlphaFold-Multimer is able to identify segments within IDRs that exhibit greater dynamic behavior. We introduce a metric that pinpoints IDR residues that most likely bind a given partner, which may make AlphaFold-Multimer-based screens for interactions more efficient. Importantly, we provide clear guidelines for using AlphaFold-Multimer to predict various types of IDR-mediated interactions.","Interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) pose formidable challenges in structural characterization. IDRs are highly versatile, capable of adopting diverse structures and engagement modes. Motivated by recent strides in protein structure prediction, we embarked on exploring the extent to which AlphaFold-Multimer can faithfully reproduce the intricacies of interactions involving IDRs. To this end, we gathered multiple datasets covering the versatile spectrum of IDR binding modes and used them to probe AlphaFold-Multimer’s prediction of IDR interactions and their dynamics. Our analyses revealed that AlphaFold-Multimer is not only capable of predicting various types of bound IDR structures with high success rate, but that distinguishing true interactions from decoys, and unreliable predictions from accurate ones is achievable by appropriate use of AlphaFold-Multimer’s intrinsic scores. We found that the quality of predictions drops for more heterogeneous, fuzzy interaction types, most likely due to lower interface hydrophobicity and higher coil content. Notably though, certain AlphaFold-Multimer scores, such as the Predicted Aligned Error and residue-ipTM, are highly correlated with structural heterogeneity of the bound IDR, enabling clear distinctions between predictions of fuzzy and more homogeneous binding modes. Finally, our benchmarking revealed that predictions of IDR interactions can also be successful when using full-length proteins, but not as accurate as with cognate IDRs. To facilitate identification of the cognate IDR of a given partner, we established “minD,” which pinpoints potential interaction sites in a full-length protein. Our study demonstrates that AlphaFold-Multimer can correctly identify interacting IDRs and predict their mode of engagement with a given partner."
212,Macrophages release neuraminidase and cleaved calreticulin for programmed cell removal,Immunology and Inflammation,"This study provides insights into the mechanisms by which macrophages mark target cells for programmed cell removal (PrCR). We demonstrate that activated macrophages secrete a C-terminally cleaved version of Calreticulin (CALR), which acts as a functional “eat-me” signal, decorating target cells and guiding them for PrCR. We implicate cathepsins as proteases involved in this cleavage event. Additionally, we reveal that macrophages release neuraminidase, which modifies target cell surfaces, facilitating CALR binding. These findings uncover a coordinated process by which macrophages regulate their signaling and target cell recognition, contributing to immune surveillance and the clearance of unwanted cells. Understanding these mechanisms could inform therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing immune clearance of dying cells, cancer cells, and/or damaged and pathogenic cells.","Calreticulin (CALR) is primarily an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein that also plays a key role in facilitating programmed cell removal (PrCR) by acting as an “eat-me” signal for macrophages, directing their recognition and engulfment of dying, diseased, or unwanted cells. Recent findings have demonstrated that macrophages can transfer their own CALR onto exposed asialoglycans on target cells, marking them for PrCR. Despite the critical role CALR plays in this process, the molecular mechanisms behind its secretion by macrophages and the formation of binding sites on target cells remain unclear. Our findings show that CALR undergoes C-terminal cleavage upon secretion, producing a truncated form that functions as the active eat-me signal detectable on target cells. We identify cathepsins as potential proteases involved in this cleavage process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that macrophages release neuraminidases, which modify the surface of target cells and facilitate CALR binding. These insights reveal a coordinated mechanism through which lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages regulate CALR cleavage and neuraminidase activity to mark target cells for PrCR. How they recognize the cells to be targeted remains unknown."
213,Global analysis of depletion and recovery of seabed biota after bottom trawling disturbance,Ecology,"Bottom trawling is the most widespread source of physical disturbance to the world’s seabed. Predictions of trawling impacts are needed to underpin risk assessment, and they are relevant for the fishing industry, conservation, management, and certification bodies. We estimate depletion and recovery of seabed biota after trawling by fitting models to data from a global data compilation. Trawl gears removed 6–41% of faunal biomass per pass, and recovery times posttrawling were 1.9–6.4 y depending on fisheries and environmental context. These results allow the estimation of trawling impacts on unprecedented spatial scales and for data poor fisheries and enable an objective analysis of tradeoffs between harvesting fish and the wider ecosystem effects of such activities.","Bottom trawling is the most widespread human activity affecting seabed habitats. Here, we collate all available data for experimental and comparative studies of trawling impacts on whole communities of seabed macroinvertebrates on sedimentary habitats and develop widely applicable methods to estimate depletion and recovery rates of biota after trawling. Depletion of biota and trawl penetration into the seabed are highly correlated. Otter trawls caused the least depletion, removing 6% of biota per pass and penetrating the seabed on average down to 2.4 cm, whereas hydraulic dredges caused the most depletion, removing 41% of biota and penetrating the seabed on average 16.1 cm. Median recovery times posttrawling (from 50 to 95% of unimpacted biomass) ranged between 1.9 and 6.4 y. By accounting for the effects of penetration depth, environmental variation, and uncertainty, the models explained much of the variability of depletion and recovery estimates from single studies. Coupled with large-scale, high-resolution maps of trawling frequency and habitat, our estimates of depletion and recovery rates enable the assessment of trawling impacts on unprecedented spatial scales."
214,Plastic debris in the open ocean,Environmental Sciences,"High concentrations of floating plastic debris have been reported in remote areas of the ocean, increasing concern about the accumulation of plastic litter on the ocean surface. Since the introduction of plastic materials in the 1950s, the global production of plastic has increased rapidly and will continue in the coming decades. However, the abundance and the distribution of plastic debris in the open ocean are still unknown, despite evidence of affects on organisms ranging from small invertebrates to whales. In this work, we synthetize data collected across the world to provide a global map and a first-order approximation of the magnitude of the plastic pollution in surface waters of the open ocean.","There is a rising concern regarding the accumulation of floating plastic debris in the open ocean. However, the magnitude and the fate of this pollution are still open questions. Using data from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation, regional surveys, and previously published reports, we show a worldwide distribution of plastic on the surface of the open ocean, mostly accumulating in the convergence zones of each of the five subtropical gyres with comparable density. However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface was estimated to be on the order of tens of thousands of tons, far less than expected. Our observations of the size distribution of floating plastic debris point at important size-selective sinks removing millimeter-sized fragments of floating plastic on a large scale. This sink may involve a combination of fast nano-fragmentation of the microplastic into particles of microns or smaller, their transference to the ocean interior by food webs and ballasting processes, and processes yet to be discovered. Resolving the fate of the missing plastic debris is of fundamental importance to determine the nature and significance of the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean."
215,Approaching infinite affinity through engineering of peptide–protein interaction,Biochemistry,"Interactions between proteins normally depend on a range of noncovalent contacts. Under challenging conditions, such as with mechanical force or over long time periods, noncovalent interactions break. Unbreakable protein–protein interactions, linked by covalent bonding, provide many opportunities for robust connection of molecular building blocks, including for biomaterials, enzymes, and vaccines. When evaluating unbreakable interactions, it is important to consider whether reaction happens quickly even at low concentrations. Here we establish a genetically encoded peptide that reacts with its genetically encoded protein partner with a speed close to the limit set by diffusion. We apply a range of biophysical methods to understand the dynamics required for this interaction, demonstrating applicability to rapid and specific detection in a range of species.","Much of life’s complexity depends upon contacts between proteins with precise affinity and specificity. The successful application of engineered proteins often depends on high-stability binding to their target. In recent years, various approaches have enabled proteins to form irreversible covalent interactions with protein targets. However, the rate of such reactions is a major limitation to their use. Infinite affinity refers to the ideal where such covalent interaction occurs at the diffusion limit. Prototypes of infinite affinity pairs have been achieved using nonnatural reactive groups. After library-based evolution and rational design, here we establish a peptide–protein pair composed of the regular 20 amino acids that link together through an amide bond at a rate approaching the diffusion limit. Reaction occurs in a few minutes with both partners at low nanomolar concentration. Stopped flow fluorimetry illuminated the conformational dynamics involved in docking and reaction. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry gave insight into the conformational flexibility of this split protein and the process of enhancing its reaction rate. We applied this reactive pair for specific labeling of a plasma membrane target in 1 min on live mammalian cells. Sensitive and specific detection was also confirmed by Western blot in a range of model organisms. The peptide–protein pair allowed reconstitution of a critical mechanotransmitter in the cytosol of mammalian cells, restoring cell adhesion and migration. This simple genetic encoding for rapid irreversible reaction should provide diverse opportunities to enhance protein function by rapid detection, stable anchoring, and multiplexing of protein functionality."
216,RepeatModeler2 for automated genomic discovery of transposable element families,Genetics,"Genome sequences are being produced for more and more eukaryotic species. The bulk of these genomes are composed of parasitic, self-mobilizing transposable elements (TEs) that play important roles in organismal evolution. Thus there is a pressing need for developing software that can accurately identify the diverse set of TEs dispersed in genome sequences. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, an easy-to-use package for the production of reference TE libraries which can be applied to any eukaryotic species. Through several major improvements over the previous version, RepeatModeler2 is able to produce libraries that recapitulate the known composition of three model species with some of the most complex TE landscapes. Thus RepeatModeler2 will greatly enhance the discovery and annotation of TEs in genome sequences.","The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with >95% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences. RepeatModeler2 is available as source code or a containerized package under an open license (https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler, http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/)."
217,"Auditing YouTube’s recommendation system for ideologically congenial, extreme, and problematic recommendations",Computer Sciences,"YouTube’s algorithm is often accused of putting users in filter bubbles and generating rabbit holes of radicalization. However, evidence on these issues is inconclusive. We conduct a systematic audit of the platform using 100,000 sock puppets that allow us to isolate the influence of the algorithm in recommendations to ideologically congenial and increasingly extreme and problematic videos. YouTube’s algorithm recommends ideologically congenial content to partisan users, and congenial recommendations increase deeper in the recommendation trail for right-leaning users. Although we do not find meaningful increases in ideological extremity of recommendations, we show that a growing proportion of recommendations deeper in the recommendation trail come from extremist, conspiratorial, and otherwise problematic channels. This increase is most pronounced among the right-leaning users.","Algorithms of social media platforms are often criticized for recommending ideologically congenial and radical content to their users. Despite these concerns, evidence on such filter bubbles and rabbit holes of radicalization is inconclusive. We conduct an audit of the platform using 100,000 sock puppets that allow us to systematically and at scale isolate the influence of the algorithm in recommendations. We test 1) whether recommended videos are congenial with regard to users’ ideology, especially deeper in the watch trail and whether 2) recommendations deeper in the trail become progressively more extreme and come from problematic channels. We find that YouTube’s algorithm recommends congenial content to its partisan users, although some moderate and cross-cutting exposure is possible and that congenial recommendations increase deeper in the trail for right-leaning users. We do not find meaningful increases in ideological extremity of recommendations deeper in the trail, yet we show that a growing proportion of recommendations comes from channels categorized as problematic (e.g., “IDW,” “Alt-right,” “Conspiracy,” and “QAnon”), with this increase being most pronounced among the very-right users. Although the proportion of these problematic recommendations is low (max of 2.5%), they are still encountered by over 36.1% of users and up to 40% in the case of very-right users."
218,Risk-aware electricity dispatch with large-scale distributed renewable integration under climate extremes,Engineering,"Electric power system infrastructure faces significant challenges under climate extremes such as hurricanes, particularly in distribution networks involving large-scale distributed renewable systems. Current electricity dispatch approaches focus on the transmission network, not accurately accounting for distribution-level risks that threaten power balance. We present a risk-aware optimization model integrating these risks into electricity dispatch with cost-effective, flexible solutions. Using the test system of the 2022 Puerto Rico power grid under Hurricane Fiona, this model reduces reliance on additional flexibility resources and achieves significant cost savings compared to conventional methods. Sensitivity analysis of various distributed renewable integration levels consistently demonstrates its superiority, highlighting a practical solution for operating future net-zero power systems under intensifying climate risks.","Distribution networks, with large-scale integration of distributed renewable resources, particularly rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, represent the most extensive yet vulnerable components of modern electric power systems during climate extremes such as hurricanes. However, existing day-ahead electricity dispatch approaches primarily focus on the transmission network and lack the capability to manage the spatiotemporal risks associated with the vast distribution networks, which can potentially lead to significant power imbalances due to the mismatches between scheduled generation and actual demand. To address this increasingly critical gap under intensifying climate extremes and growing distributed renewable integration, we introduce Risk-aware Electricity Dispatch under Climate Extremes with Renewable integration (REDUCER), a risk-aware day-ahead electricity dispatch model that incorporates high-resolution spatiotemporal risk analysis for distribution networks with large-scale distributed renewable integration into an Entropic Value-at-Risk-constrained mixed-integer convex optimization framework. Applied to the 2022 Puerto Rico power grid under Hurricane Fiona, the proposed REDUCER model is seen to effectively manage these risks with substantially less reliance on additional flexibility resources to cope with power imbalances, reducing overall operational costs by about 30% under extreme cases compared to standard unit commitment strategies already informed by average demand loss. Also, the proposed REDUCER model consistently demonstrates its effectiveness in managing the increasing temporal net demand variability introduced by growing large-scale distributed solar integration while maintaining minimal operational costs. This model offers a practical solution for cost-effective and resilient electricity dispatch of modern power systems with large-scale renewable integration facing intensifying climate risks."
219,Optimism is associated with exceptional longevity in 2 epidemiologic cohorts of men and women,Medical Sciences,"Optimism is a psychological attribute characterized as the general expectation that good things will happen, or the belief that the future will be favorable because one can control important outcomes. Previous studies reported that more optimistic individuals are less likely to suffer from chronic diseases and die prematurely. Our results further suggest that optimism is specifically related to 11 to 15% longer life span, on average, and to greater odds of achieving “exceptional longevity,” that is, living to the age of 85 or beyond. These relations were independent of socioeconomic status, health conditions, depression, social integration, and health behaviors (e.g., smoking, diet, and alcohol use). Overall, findings suggest optimism may be an important psychosocial resource for extending life span in older adults.","Most research on exceptional longevity has investigated biomedical factors associated with survival, but recent work suggests nonbiological factors are also important. Thus, we tested whether higher optimism was associated with longer life span and greater likelihood of exceptional longevity. Data are from 2 cohorts, women from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and men from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS), with follow-up of 10 y (2004 to 2014) and 30 y (1986 to 2016), respectively. Optimism was assessed using the Life Orientation Test–Revised in NHS and the Revised Optimism–Pessimism Scale from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 in NAS. Exceptional longevity was defined as survival to age 85 or older. Primary analyses used accelerated failure time models to assess differences in life span associated with optimism; models adjusted for demographic confounders and health conditions, and subsequently considered the role of health behaviors. Further analyses used logistic regression to evaluate the likelihood of exceptional longevity. In both sexes, we found a dose-dependent association of higher optimism levels at baseline with increased longevity (P trend < 0.01). For example, adjusting for demographics and health conditions, women in the highest versus lowest optimism quartile had 14.9% (95% confidence interval, 11.9 to 18.0) longer life span. Findings were similar in men. Participants with highest versus lowest optimism levels had 1.5 (women) and 1.7 (men) greater odds of surviving to age 85; these relationships were maintained after adjusting for health behaviors. Given work indicating optimism is modifiable, these findings suggest optimism may provide a valuable target to test for strategies to promote longevity."
220,Vertebrates on the brink as indicators of biological annihilation and the sixth mass extinction,Environmental Sciences,"The ongoing sixth mass extinction may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible. Thousands of populations of critically endangered vertebrate animal species have been lost in a century, indicating that the sixth mass extinction is human caused and accelerating. The acceleration of the extinction crisis is certain because of the still fast growth in human numbers and consumption rates. In addition, species are links in ecosystems, and, as they fall out, the species they interact with are likely to go also. In the regions where disappearing species are concentrated, regional biodiversity collapses are likely occurring. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking massive global actions to save humanity’s crucial life-support systems.","The ongoing sixth mass species extinction is the result of the destruction of component populations leading to eventual extirpation of entire species. Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear—extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity’s crucial life-support systems from this existential threat."
221,Distantly related bacteria share a rigid proteome allocation strategy with flexible enzyme kinetics,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Different bacterial species can grow at different rates in their respective optimal growth conditions. What makes some grow faster than others? Of particular interest is Vibrio natriegens, one of the fastest growing bacterial species known, and a desirable chassis for numerous synthetic biology applications. This work shows that V. natriegens adapts its proteome in different growth conditions much like well-studied model bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis; it grows faster because its enzymes are faster, as if it were growing at higher temperatures. The quantitative, comparative proteomic analysis presented here reveals a high degree of similarity between proteomes of species far apart in phylogeny, raising the question of the underlying physiological constraints driving this convergent evolutionary process.","Bacteria are known to allocate their proteomes according to how fast they grow, and the allocation strategies employed strongly affect bacterial adaptation to different environments. Much of what is currently known about proteome allocation is based on extensive studies of the model organism Escherichia coli. It is not clear how much of E. coli’s proteome allocation strategy is applicable to other species, particularly since different species can grow at vastly different rates even in the same growth condition. In this study, we investigate differences in nutrient-dependent proteome allocation programs adopted by several distantly related bacterial species, including Vibrio natriegens, one of the fastest-growing bacteria known. Extensive quantitative proteome characterization across conditions reveals an invariant allocation program in response to changing nutrients despite systemic, species-specific differences in enzyme kinetics. This invariant program is not organized according to the growth rate but is based on a common internal metric of nutrient quality after scaling away species-specific differences in enzyme kinetics, with the faster species behaving as if it is growing under a higher temperature. The flexibility of enzyme kinetics and the rigidity of proteome allocation programs across species defy common notions of evolvability and resource optimization. Our results suggest the existence of a blueprint of proteome allocation shared by diverse bacterial species, with implications on common underlying regulatory strategies. Further knowledge on the existence and organization of such phylogeny-transcending relations also promises to simplify the bottom–up description and understanding of bacterial behaviors in ecological communities."
222,DELLA proteins regulate arbuscule formation in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis,Plant Biology,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a mutualistic interaction formed between most land plants and soil fungi. During symbiosis the fungus develops branched hyphae, known as arbuscules, inside the root cortical cells. Arbuscules are critical to the symbiosis and function in phosphate delivery to the plant. Here we show that arbuscule formation is regulated by DELLA proteins. DELLA proteins are negative regulators of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling and repress plant growth and development. Our data provide insights into regulation of arbuscule formation and identify a potential mechanism by which the plant can coordinate the symbiosis with its growth and nutrient status.","Most flowering plants are able to form endosymbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this mutualistic association, the fungus colonizes the root cortex and establishes elaborately branched hyphae, called arbuscules, within the cortical cells. Arbuscule development requires the cellular reorganization of both symbionts, and the resulting symbiotic interface functions in nutrient exchange. A plant symbiosis signaling pathway controls the development of the symbiosis. Several components of the pathway have been identified, but transcriptional regulators that control downstream pathways for arbuscule formation are still unknown. Here we show that DELLA proteins, which are repressors of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling and function at the nexus of several signaling pathways, are required for arbuscule formation. Arbuscule formation is severely impaired in a Medicago truncatula Mtdella1/Mtdella2 double mutant; GA treatment of wild-type roots phenocopies the della double mutant, and a dominant DELLA protein (della1-Δ18) enables arbuscule formation in the presence of GA. Ectopic expression of della1-Δ18 suggests that DELLA activity in the vascular tissue and endodermis is sufficient to enable arbuscule formation in the inner cortical cells. In addition, expression of della1-Δ18 restores arbuscule formation in the symbiosis signaling pathway mutant cyclops/ipd3, indicating an intersection between DELLA and symbiosis signaling for arbuscule formation. GA signaling also influences arbuscule formation in monocots, and a Green Revolution wheat variety carrying dominant DELLA alleles shows enhanced colonization but a limited growth response to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis."
223,Proteomic comparison defines novel markers to characterize heterogeneous populations of extracellular vesicle subtypes,Cell Biology,"The last decade has seen a rapid expansion of interest in extracellular vesicles (EVs), proposed to mediate cell–cell communication in patho/physiological conditions. Although heterogeneity of EVs has become obvious, as highlighted recently by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles, the field is lacking specific tools to distinguish EVs of different intracellular origins, and thus probably different functions. Here, thanks to a comprehensive comparison of different types of EVs isolated from a single cell type, we define proteins generically present in EVs, small EV-specific and -excluded ones, and a few specific of endosome-derived exosomes or nonexosomal small EVs. This work will allow proper evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of biogenesis and secretion and the respective functions of subtypes of EVs.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become the focus of rising interest because of their numerous functions in physiology and pathology. Cells release heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins, including small EVs formed inside endosomal compartments (i.e., exosomes) and EVs of various sizes budding from the plasma membrane. Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9. Our work thus provides guidelines to define subtypes of EVs for future functional studies."
224,Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates,Neuroscience,"Functional MRI (fMRI) is 25 years old, yet surprisingly its most common statistical methods have not been validated using real data. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from 499 healthy controls to conduct 3 million task group analyses. Using this null data with different experimental designs, we estimate the incidence of significant results. In theory, we should find 5% false positives (for a significance threshold of 5%), but instead we found that the most common software packages for fMRI analysis (SPM, FSL, AFNI) can result in false-positive rates of up to 70%. These results question the validity of a number of fMRI studies and may have a large impact on the interpretation of weakly significant neuroimaging results.","The most widely used task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses use parametric statistical methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging."
225,Accurate genomic variant detection in single cells with primary template-directed amplification,Genetics,"Primary template-directed amplification (PTA) is a major improvement in whole genome amplification, which is required to study intratissue cellular evolution. As presented in the manuscript, PTA produces significantly improved and reproducible genome sequencing coverage and variant detection from a single genome of a single cell. Applications of measuring genetic diversity from single cells with PTA presented in the manuscript include examining the acquisition of genetic changes during normal development and aging, measuring the consequences of specific perturbations such as genome editing, and characterizing the evolution of clonal populations during cancer formation.","Improvements in whole genome amplification (WGA) would enable new types of basic and applied biomedical research, including studies of intratissue genetic diversity that require more accurate single-cell genotyping. Here, we present primary template-directed amplification (PTA), an isothermal WGA method that reproducibly captures >95% of the genomes of single cells in a more uniform and accurate manner than existing approaches, resulting in significantly improved variant calling sensitivity and precision. To illustrate the types of studies that are enabled by PTA, we developed direct measurement of environmental mutagenicity (DMEM), a tool for mapping genome-wide interactions of mutagens with single living human cells at base-pair resolution. In addition, we utilized PTA for genome-wide off-target indel and structural variant detection in cells that had undergone CRISPR-mediated genome editing, establishing the feasibility for performing single-cell evaluations of biopsies from edited tissues. The improved precision and accuracy of variant detection with PTA overcomes the current limitations of accurate WGA, which is the major obstacle to studying genetic diversity and evolution at cellular resolution."
226,Psychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology,Cell Biology,"Psychosocial experiences predict health trajectories, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We report that positive psychosocial experiences are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial energy transformation machinery, whereas negative experiences are linked to lower abundance. Overall, psychosocial experiences accounted for 18 to 25% of the variance in protein abundance for complex I, the largest and most upstream mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) enzyme. At single-cell resolution, positive psychosocial experiences were particularly related to glial cell mitochondrial phenotypes. As a result, opposite associations between glial cells and neurons were naturally masked in bulk transcriptomic analyses. Our results suggest that mitochondrial recalibrations in specific brain cell types may represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking psychosocial experiences to human brain health.","Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these “mind-mitochondria” associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes."
227,Birds have primate-like numbers of neurons in the forebrain,Neuroscience,"Birds are remarkably intelligent, although their brains are small. Corvids and some parrots are capable of cognitive feats comparable to those of great apes. How do birds achieve impressive cognitive prowess with walnut-sized brains? We investigated the cellular composition of the brains of 28 avian species, uncovering a straightforward solution to the puzzle: brains of songbirds and parrots contain very large numbers of neurons, at neuronal densities considerably exceeding those found in mammals. Because these “extra” neurons are predominantly located in the forebrain, large parrots and corvids have the same or greater forebrain neuron counts as monkeys with much larger brains. Avian brains thus have the potential to provide much higher “cognitive power” per unit mass than do mammalian brains.","Some birds achieve primate-like levels of cognition, even though their brains tend to be much smaller in absolute size. This poses a fundamental problem in comparative and computational neuroscience, because small brains are expected to have a lower information-processing capacity. Using the isotropic fractionator to determine numbers of neurons in specific brain regions, here we show that the brains of parrots and songbirds contain on average twice as many neurons as primate brains of the same mass, indicating that avian brains have higher neuron packing densities than mammalian brains. Additionally, corvids and parrots have much higher proportions of brain neurons located in the pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals and birds. Thus, large-brained parrots and corvids have forebrain neuron counts equal to or greater than primates with much larger brains. We suggest that the large numbers of neurons concentrated in high densities in the telencephalon substantially contribute to the neural basis of avian intelligence."
228,Computational biology predicts metabolic engineering targets for increased production of 103 valuable chemicals in yeast,Applied Biological Sciences,"Prediction of metabolic engineering targets through mathematical modeling can reduce costs of strain development. Here, we developed a computational pipeline, ecFactory, designed to predict optimal gene targets for enhancing the production of 103 valuable chemicals by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using enzyme-constrained metabolic models. The ecFactory helps to reduce the extensive lists of candidate gene targets for metabolic engineering, thereby simplifying the experimental validation process and accelerating the development of high-producing strains. The predictive capabilities of ecFactory were assessed based on reported experimental results, showcasing that it could successfully predict the gene targets for strain metabolic engineering. The identification of common gene targets for groups of chemicals opens up the possibility of creating platform strains with versatile applications.","Development of efficient cell factories that can compete with traditional chemical production processes is complex and generally driven by case-specific strategies, based on the product and microbial host of interest. Despite major advancements in the field of metabolic modeling in recent years, prediction of genetic modifications for increased production remains challenging. Here, we present a computational pipeline that leverages the concept of protein limitations in metabolism for prediction of optimal combinations of gene engineering targets for enhanced chemical bioproduction. We used our pipeline for prediction of engineering targets for 103 different chemicals using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host. Furthermore, we identified sets of gene targets predicted for groups of multiple chemicals, suggesting the possibility of rational model-driven design of platform strains for diversified chemical production."
229,The Matthew effect in science funding,Social Sciences,"Why do scientists with similar backgrounds and abilities often end up achieving very different degrees of success? A classic explanation is that academic achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Early successes increase future success chances. We analyze data from a large academic funding program that present a unique opportunity to quantify the Matthew effect and identify generative mechanisms. Our results show that winners just above the funding threshold accumulate more than twice as much funding during the subsequent eight years as nonwinners with near-identical review scores that fall just below the threshold. This effect is partly caused by nonwinners ceasing to compete for other funding opportunities, revealing a “participation” mechanism driving the Matthew effect.","A classic thesis is that scientific achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to succeed again, producing increasing distinction. We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a €2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (€180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners’ improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding. Surprisingly, however, the emergent funding gap is partly created by applicants, who, after failing to win one grant, apply for another grant less often."
230,Soil biodiversity and soil community composition determine ecosystem multifunctionality,Ecology,"Biological diversity is the foundation for the maintenance of ecosystems. Consequently it is thought that anthropogenic activities that reduce the diversity in ecosystems threaten ecosystem performance. A large proportion of the biodiversity within terrestrial ecosystems is hidden below ground in soils, and the impact of altering its diversity and composition on the performance of ecosystems is still poorly understood. Using a novel experimental system to alter levels of soil biodiversity and community composition, we found that reductions in the abundance and presence of soil organisms results in the decline of multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity and nutrient cycling and retention. This suggests that below-ground biodiversity is a key resource for maintaining the functioning of ecosystems.","Biodiversity loss has become a global concern as evidence accumulates that it will negatively affect ecosystem services on which society depends. So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth’s biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning. Our results indicate that changes in soil communities and the loss of soil biodiversity threaten ecosystem multifunctionality and sustainability."
231,Measuring the predictability of life outcomes with a scientific mass collaboration,Social Sciences,"Hundreds of researchers attempted to predict six life outcomes, such as a child’s grade point average and whether a family would be evicted from their home. These researchers used machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, and they drew on a vast dataset that was painstakingly collected by social scientists over 15 y. However, no one made very accurate predictions. For policymakers considering using predictive models in settings such as criminal justice and child-protective services, these results raise a number of concerns. Additionally, researchers must reconcile the idea that they understand life trajectories with the fact that none of the predictions were very accurate.","How predictable are life trajectories? We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences."
232,Critical role of the CD44lowCD62Llow CD8+ T cell subset in restoring antitumor immunity in aged mice,Immunology and Inflammation,"Although aging is known to suppress antitumor immunity, the precise underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we found that the inefficient generation of CD44lowCD62Llow CD8+ T cell subset (P4), pre-effector–like T cells, could explain the resistance to PD-1 blockade antitumor therapy in aged mice. Elevated expression of CD45RB in aged naive CD8+ T cells appears to inhibit TCR signaling, resulting in fewer P4 cells, a subset with high expression of 1C metabolic genes. This decrease in P4 cells and antitumor activity was rescued by strong immunogenic stimulation by nonself cells. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism underlying age-induced suppression of antitumor immunity, which may provide a basis for the development of therapeutic strategies for elderly cancer patients.","CD8+ T cells play a central role in antitumor immune responses that kill cancer cells directly. In aged individuals, CD8+ T cell immunity is strongly suppressed, which is associated with cancer and other age-related diseases. The mechanism underlying this age-related decrease in immune function remains largely unknown. This study investigated the role of T cell function in age-related unresponsiveness to PD-1 blockade cancer therapy. We found inefficient generation of CD44lowCD62Llow CD8+ T cell subset (P4) in draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing aged mice. In vitro stimulation of naive CD8+ T cells first generated P4 cells, followed by effector/memory T cells. The P4 cells contained a unique set of genes related to enzymes involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism, which is critical to antigen-specific T cell activation and mitochondrial function. Consistent with this finding, 1C-metabolism–related gene expression and mitochondrial respiration were down-regulated in aged CD8+ T cells compared with young CD8+ T cells. In aged OVA-specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, ZAP-70 was not activated, even after inoculation with OVA-expressing tumor cells. The attenuation of TCR signaling appeared to be due to elevated expression of CD45RB phosphatase in aged CD8+ T cells. Surprisingly, strong stimulation by nonself cell injection into aged PD-1–deficient mice restored normal levels of CD45RB and ameliorated the emergence of P4 cells and 1C metabolic enzyme expression in CD8+ T cells, and antitumor activity. These findings indicate that impaired induction of the P4 subset may be responsible for the age-related resistance to PD-1 blockade, which can be rescued by strong TCR stimulation."
233,Aversive memories can be weakened during human sleep via the reactivation of positive interfering memories,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"The usefulness of memory has limits; aversive memories, and especially their involuntary emergence, can be debilitating. Prior research suggested that reactivating positive memories can benefit psychological health, and that memory reactivation can be triggered during human sleep. Here, we introduced a memory editing procedure to weaken aversive memories by reactivating newer positive memories during sleep. We found that this procedure weakened the recall of aversive memories and also increased involuntary intrusions of positive memories. Moreover, reactivation enhanced positive affective judgments after sleep. Our findings open broad avenues for seeking to weaken aversive or traumatic memories.","Recollecting painful or traumatic experiences can be deeply troubling. Sleep may offer an opportunity to reduce such suffering. We developed a procedure to weaken older aversive memories by reactivating newer positive memories during sleep. Participants viewed 48 nonsense words each paired with a unique aversive image, followed by an overnight sleep. In the next evening, participants learned associations between half of the words and additional positive images, creating interference. During the following non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, auditory memory cues were unobtrusively delivered. Upon waking, presenting cues associated with both aversive and positive images during sleep, as opposed to not presenting cues, weakened aversive memory recall while increasing positive memory intrusions. Substantiating these memory benefits, computational modeling revealed that cueing facilitated evidence accumulation toward positive affect judgments. Moreover, cue-elicited theta brain rhythms during sleep predominantly predicted the recall of positive memories. A noninvasive sleep intervention can thus modify aversive recollection and affective responses."
234,A disease-specific convergence of host and Epstein–Barr virus genetics in multiple sclerosis,Immunology and Inflammation,"The etiology of multiple sclerosis remains unclear. As a result, current therapies, though effective, target disease mechanisms rather than the underlying causes. Hence, there is a need to prolong treatments for years, if not decades. Recent evidence highlights Epstein–Barr virus as a key factor in disease development, opening new opportunities for the development of therapies that target one of the root causes of the disease. By integrating diverse experimental approaches, we uncover disease-specific host–virus interactions and show that at-risk human and viral genetic factors converge on similar mechanisms. Such mechanisms, and the identified at-risk viral subtypes, may inform highly targeted preventive or therapeutic strategies.","Recent sero-epidemiological studies have strengthened the hypothesis that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) may be a causal factor in multiple sclerosis (MS). Given the complexity of the EBV–host interaction, various mechanisms may be responsible for the disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether this is a disease-specific process. Here, we showed that genes encoding EBV interactors are enriched in loci associated with MS but not with other diseases and in prioritized therapeutic targets. Analyses of MS blood and brain transcriptomes confirmed a dysregulation of MS-associated EBV interactors affecting the CD40 pathway. Such interactors were strongly enriched in binding sites for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) viral transcriptional regulator, often in colocalization with CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and RNA Polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A). EBNA2 was expressed in the MS brain. The 1.2 EBNA2 allele downregulated the expression of the CD40 MS-associated gene analogously to the CD40 MS-risk variant. Finally, we showed that the 1.2 EBNA2 allele associates with the risk of MS. This study delineates how host and viral genetic variability converge in MS-specific pathogenetic mechanisms."
235,Intussusceptive angiogenesis-on-a-chip: Evidence for transluminal vascular bridging by endothelial delamination,Physiology,"Rapid generation of small blood vessels is vital for embryonic development and many diseases. An efficient means of creating a new microvessel is for an existing vessel to split into two, a process recognized for over 35 years. However, the cellular events underlying vessel splitting remain largely a mystery. The challenge is how to look inside a microvessel and capture transient events. We address this challenge using a microvessel-on-a-chip strategy. We found that select endothelial cells lining the wall can partially lift to transect the lumen. This resolves the paradox of an adhesion-dependent cell reaching across a pressurized lumen. It also reframes microvascular therapy considerations, including for diabetics with leg ulcers, a condition we show has hallmarks of microvessel splitting.","Intussusceptive angiogenesis is an increasingly recognized vessel duplication process that generates and reshapes microvascular beds. However, the mechanism by which a vessel splits into two is poorly understood. Particularly vexing is formation of the hallmark transluminal endothelial cell bridge. How an endothelial cell comes to cross a flowing lumen rather than line it is enigmatic. To elucidate this, we used a microvessel-on-a-chip strategy, creating a microconduit coherently lined with flow-sensitive endothelial cells but in which transluminal bridges also formed. Bridge morphologies ranged from filamentous strand to multicellular columns with a central extracellular matrix-containing core. These bridge architectures were found to recapitulate those in microvessels in embryos, tumors, diseased organs, and the dermis of patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Time-lapse, multiplane, three-dimensional (3D) microscopy of the microphysiologic conduit revealed that bridges arose from endothelial cells oriented orthogonal to flow that partially released from the wall while retaining attachments at the ends. This delamination process was blocked by hyperactivation of Rho and augmented by interventions that weaken cell–substrate interactions, including inhibiting nonmuscle myosin II and blocking α5ß1 integrin. Thus, endothelial cells can leave their monolayer and transect a flowing lumen through controlled delamination. This previously unrecognized lumen entry program could explain the launch of intussusceptive angiogenesis and opens a framework for intervening."
236,Assessing agricultural risks of climate change in the 21st century in a global gridded crop model intercomparison,Agricultural Sciences,"Agriculture is arguably the sector most affected by climate change, but assessments differ and are thus difficult to compare. We provide a globally consistent, protocol-based, multimodel climate change assessment for major crops with explicit characterization of uncertainty. Results with multimodel agreement indicate strong negative effects from climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes where developing countries are concentrated. Simulations that consider explicit nitrogen stress result in much more severe impacts from climate change, with implications for adaptation planning.","Here we present the results from an intercomparison of multiple global gridded crop models (GGCMs) within the framework of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project. Results indicate strong negative effects of climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes; models that include explicit nitrogen stress project more severe impacts. Across seven GGCMs, five global climate models, and four representative concentration pathways, model agreement on direction of yield changes is found in many major agricultural regions at both low and high latitudes; however, reducing uncertainty in sign of response in mid-latitude regions remains a challenge. Uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and high temperature effects demonstrated here show that further research is urgently needed to better understand effects of climate change on agricultural production and to devise targeted adaptation strategies."
237,Testosterone causes both prosocial and antisocial status-enhancing behaviors in human males,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Although in several species of bird and animal, testosterone increases male–male aggression, in human males, it has been suggested to instead promote both aggressive and nonaggressive behaviors that enhance social status. However, causal evidence distinguishing these accounts is lacking. Here, we tested between these hypotheses in men injected with testosterone or placebo in a double-blind, randomized design. Participants played a modified Ultimatum Game, which included the opportunity to punish or reward the other player. Administration of testosterone caused increased punishment of the other player but also, increased reward of larger offers. These findings show that testosterone can cause prosocial behavior in males and provide causal evidence for the social status hypothesis in men.","Although popular discussion of testosterone’s influence on males often centers on aggression and antisocial behavior, contemporary theorists have proposed that it instead enhances behaviors involved in obtaining and maintaining a high social status. Two central distinguishing but untested predictions of this theory are that testosterone selectively increases status-relevant aggressive behaviors, such as responses to provocation, but that it also promotes nonaggressive behaviors, such as generosity toward others, when they are appropriate for increasing status. Here, we tested these hypotheses in healthy young males by injecting testosterone enanthate or a placebo in a double-blind, between-subjects, randomized design (n = 40). Participants played a version of the Ultimatum Game that was modified so that, having accepted or rejected an offer from the proposer, participants then had the opportunity to punish or reward the proposer at a proportionate cost to themselves. We found that participants treated with testosterone were more likely to punish the proposer and that higher testosterone levels were specifically associated with increased punishment of proposers who made unfair offers, indicating that testosterone indeed potentiates aggressive responses to provocation. Furthermore, when participants administered testosterone received large offers, they were more likely to reward the proposer and also chose rewards of greater magnitude. This increased generosity in the absence of provocation indicates that testosterone can also cause prosocial behaviors that are appropriate for increasing status. These findings are inconsistent with a simple relationship between testosterone and aggression and provide causal evidence for a more complex role for testosterone in driving status-enhancing behaviors in males."
238,Pliocene and Eocene provide best analogs for near-future climates,"Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences","The expected departure of future climates from those experienced in human history challenges efforts to adapt. Possible analogs to climates from deep in Earth’s geological past have been suggested but not formally assessed. We compare climates of the coming decades with climates drawn from six geological and historical periods spanning the past 50 My. Our study suggests that climates like those of the Pliocene will prevail as soon as 2030 CE and persist under climate stabilization scenarios. Unmitigated scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions produce climates like those of the Eocene, which suggests that we are effectively rewinding the climate clock by approximately 50 My, reversing a multimillion year cooling trend in less than two centuries.","As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129–116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 CE), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in RCP4.5 (<1%) but reach 8.7% of the globe under RCP8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, RCP4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as RCP8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity."
239,Global warming has increased global economic inequality,Sustainability Science,"We find that global warming has very likely exacerbated global economic inequality, including ∼25% increase in population-weighted between-country inequality over the past half century. This increase results from the impact of warming on annual economic growth, which over the course of decades has accumulated robust and substantial declines in economic output in hotter, poorer countries—and increases in many cooler, wealthier countries—relative to a world without anthropogenic warming. Thus, the global warming caused by fossil fuel use has likely exacerbated the economic inequality associated with historical disparities in energy consumption. Our results suggest that low-carbon energy sources have the potential to provide a substantial secondary development benefit, in addition to the primary benefits of increased energy access.","Understanding the causes of economic inequality is critical for achieving equitable economic development. To investigate whether global warming has affected the recent evolution of inequality, we combine counterfactual historical temperature trajectories from a suite of global climate models with extensively replicated empirical evidence of the relationship between historical temperature fluctuations and economic growth. Together, these allow us to generate probabilistic country-level estimates of the influence of anthropogenic climate forcing on historical economic output. We find very high likelihood that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased economic inequality between countries. For example, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has been reduced 17–31% at the poorest four deciles of the population-weighted country-level per capita GDP distribution, yielding a ratio between the top and bottom deciles that is 25% larger than in a world without global warming. As a result, although between-country inequality has decreased over the past half century, there is ∼90% likelihood that global warming has slowed that decrease. The primary driver is the parabolic relationship between temperature and economic growth, with warming increasing growth in cool countries and decreasing growth in warm countries. Although there is uncertainty in whether historical warming has benefited some temperate, rich countries, for most poor countries there is >90% likelihood that per capita GDP is lower today than if global warming had not occurred. Thus, our results show that, in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries’ energy consumption."
240,Semaphorin 6A phase separation sustains a histone lactylation–dependent lactate buildup in pathological angiogenesis,Medical Sciences,"The most widely used anti-angiogenic agents for ischemic retinopathy, such as anti-VEGF, exhibit unignorable drawbacks due to insufficient efficacy and resistance. Urgent efforts are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying pathological angiogenesis to facilitate alternative therapies. Epigenetic modifications on key angiogenic regulators in endothelial cells (ECs), shaped by metabolites, are implicated in vascular dysfunction. We here identify that semaphorin 6A phase separation induces histone lactylation, which maintains sustainable glycolysis in ECs of neovascularization. Our study provides insights into the regulation of lactylation modifications via protein phase separation and identifies a checkpoint for lactylation in pathological angiogenesis. Chemical interventions aimed at disrupting the lactylation-dependent loop provide new therapeutic strategies for ischemic ocular diseases.","Ischemic retinal diseases are major causes of blindness worldwide and are characterized by pathological angiogenesis. Epigenetic alterations in response to metabolic shifts in endothelial cells (ECs) suffice to underlie excessive angiogenesis. Lactate accumulation and its subsequent histone lactylation in ECs contribute to vascular disorders. However, the regulatory mechanism of establishing and sustaining lactylation modification remains elusive. Here, we showed that lactate accumulation induced histone lactylations on H3K9 and H3K18 in neovascular ECs in the proliferative stage of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Joint CUT&Tag and scRNA-seq analyses identified Prmt5 as a target of H3K9la and H3K18la in isolated retinal ECs. EC-specific deletion of Prmt5 since the early stage of revascularization suppressed a positive feedback loop of lactate production and histone lactylation, thus inhibiting neovascular tuft formation. Mechanistically, the C-terminal intrinsically disorder region (IDR) of the transmembrane semaphorin 6A (SEMA6A) forms liquid–liquid phase separation condensates to recruit RHOA and P300, facilitating P300 phosphorylation and histone lactylation cycle. Deletion of endothelial Sema6A reduced H3K9la and H3K18la at the promoter of PRMT5 and diminished its expression. The induction of histone lactylation by SEMA6A-IDR and its pro-angiogenic effect were abrogated by deletion of Prmt5. Our study illustrates a sustainable histone lactylation machinery driven by phase separation-dependent lactyltransferase activation in dysregulated vascularization."
241,Lipid nanoparticle topology regulates endosomal escape and delivery of RNA to the cytoplasm,Engineering,"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most successful RNA delivery carriers to date and are used in FDA-approved products like the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Expanding LNP-based therapies hinges on efficient delivery to a variety of tissues and cells, a process often hindered by endosomal entrapment. It is well known that depending on lipid molecular properties, LNPs assemble into different nanostructures, but how these impart endosomal escape remains unknown. We demonstrate that combining lipid composition with nanostructure synergistically impacts the ability of LNPs to escape endosomes. LNP–RNA complexes prescribed with bicontinuous cubic and inverse hexagonal internal structures facilitate the topological transition of LNP–endosome fusion-pore formation. We show that nanostructure is a potent handle to engineer highly efficient LNPs for RNA delivery.","RNA therapeutics have the potential to resolve a myriad of genetic diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are among the most successful RNA delivery systems. Expanding their use for the treatment of more genetic diseases hinges on our ability to continuously evolve the design of LNPs with high potency, cellular-specific targeting, and low side effects. Overcoming the difficulty of releasing cargo from endocytosed LNPs remains a significant hurdle. Here, we investigate the fundamental properties of nonviral RNA nanoparticles pertaining to the activation of topological transformations of endosomal membranes and RNA translocation into the cytosol. We show that, beyond composition, LNP fusogenicity can be prescribed by designing LNP nanostructures that lower the energetic cost of fusion and fusion–pore formation with a target membrane. The inclusion of structurally active lipids leads to enhanced LNP endosomal fusion, fast evasion of endosomal entrapment, and efficacious RNA delivery. For example, conserving the lipid make-up, RNA–LNPs having cuboplex nanostructures are significantly more efficacious at endosomal escape than traditional lipoplex constructs."
242,Ocean acidification affects coral growth by reducing skeletal density,Ecology,"Ocean acidification (OA) threatens coral reef futures by reducing the concentration of carbonate ions that corals need to construct their skeletons. However, quantitative predictions of reef futures under OA are confounded by mixed responses of corals to OA in experiments and field observations. We modeled the skeletal growth of a dominant reef-building coral, Porites, as a function of seawater chemistry and validated the model against observational data. We show that OA directly and negatively affects one component of the two-step growth process (density) but not the other (linear extension). Combining our growth model with Global Climate Model output, we show that skeletal density of Porites corals could decline by up to 20.3% over the 21st century solely due to OA.","Ocean acidification (OA) is considered an important threat to coral reef ecosystems, because it reduces the availability of carbonate ions that reef-building corals need to produce their skeletons. However, while theory predicts that coral calcification rates decline as carbonate ion concentrations decrease, this prediction is not consistently borne out in laboratory manipulation experiments or in studies of corals inhabiting naturally low-pH reefs today. The skeletal growth of corals consists of two distinct processes: extension (upward growth) and densification (lateral thickening). Here, we show that skeletal density is directly sensitive to changes in seawater carbonate ion concentration and thus, to OA, whereas extension is not. We present a numerical model of Porites skeletal growth that links skeletal density with the external seawater environment via its influence on the chemistry of coral calcifying fluid. We validate the model using existing coral skeletal datasets from six Porites species collected across five reef sites and use this framework to project the impact of 21st century OA on Porites skeletal density across the global tropics. Our model predicts that OA alone will drive up to 20.3 ± 5.4% decline in the skeletal density of reef-building Porites corals."
243,Scale-dependent interactions between tree canopy cover and impervious surfaces reduce daytime urban heat during summer,Environmental Sciences,"Cities worldwide are experiencing record-breaking summer air temperatures, with serious consequences for people. Increased tree cover is suggested as a climate adaptation strategy, but the amount of tree canopy cover needed to counteract higher temperatures associated with impervious surface cover is not known. We used a bicycle-mounted measurement system to quantify the interaction of canopy cover and impervious surface cover on urban air temperature. Daytime air temperature was substantially reduced with greater canopy cover (≥40%) at the scale of a typical city block (60–90 m), especially on the hottest days. However, reducing impervious surfaces remained important for lowering nighttime temperatures. Results can guide strategies for increasing tree cover to mitigate daytime urban heat and improve residents’ well-being.","As cities warm and the need for climate adaptation strategies increases, a more detailed understanding of the cooling effects of land cover across a continuum of spatial scales will be necessary to guide management decisions. We asked how tree canopy cover and impervious surface cover interact to influence daytime and nighttime summer air temperature, and how effects vary with the spatial scale at which land-cover data are analyzed (10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-m radii). A bicycle-mounted measurement system was used to sample air temperature every 5 m along 10 transects (∼7 km length, sampled 3–12 times each) spanning a range of impervious and tree canopy cover (0–100%, each) in a midsized city in the Upper Midwest United States. Variability in daytime air temperature within the urban landscape averaged 3.5 °C (range, 1.1–5.7 °C). Temperature decreased nonlinearly with increasing canopy cover, with the greatest cooling when canopy cover exceeded 40%. The magnitude of daytime cooling also increased with spatial scale and was greatest at the size of a typical city block (60–90 m). Daytime air temperature increased linearly with increasing impervious cover, but the magnitude of warming was less than the cooling associated with increased canopy cover. Variation in nighttime air temperature averaged 2.1 °C (range, 1.2–3.0 °C), and temperature increased with impervious surface. Effects of canopy were limited at night; thus, reduction of impervious surfaces remains critical for reducing nighttime urban heat. Results suggest strategies for managing urban land-cover patterns to enhance resilience of cities to climate warming."
244,Phylogenomics reveals the evolutionary timing and pattern of butterflies and moths,Evolution,"Lepidoptera play key roles in many biological systems. Butterflies are hypothesized to have evolved contemporaneously with flowering plants, and moths are thought to have gained anti-bat defenses in response to echolocating predatory bats, but these hypotheses have largely gone untested. Using a transcriptomic, dated evolutionary tree of Lepidoptera, we demonstrate that the most recent common ancestor of Lepidoptera is considerably older than previously hypothesized. The oldest moths in crown Lepidoptera were present in the Carboniferous, some 300 million years ago, and began to diversify largely in synchrony with angiosperms. We show that multiple lineages of moths independently evolved hearing organs well before the origin of bats, rejecting the hypothesis that lepidopteran hearing organs arose in response to these predators.","Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the major superradiations of insects, comprising nearly 160,000 described extant species. As herbivores, pollinators, and prey, Lepidoptera play a fundamental role in almost every terrestrial ecosystem. Lepidoptera are also indicators of environmental change and serve as models for research on mimicry and genetics. They have been central to the development of coevolutionary hypotheses, such as butterflies with flowering plants and moths’ evolutionary arms race with echolocating bats. However, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested, because a robust lepidopteran phylogeny and timing of evolutionary novelties are lacking. To address these issues, we inferred a comprehensive phylogeny of Lepidoptera, using the largest dataset assembled for the order (2,098 orthologous protein-coding genes from transcriptomes of 186 species, representing nearly all superfamilies), and dated it with carefully evaluated synapomorphy-based fossils. The oldest members of the Lepidoptera crown group appeared in the Late Carboniferous (∼300 Ma) and fed on nonvascular land plants. Lepidoptera evolved the tube-like proboscis in the Middle Triassic (∼241 Ma), which allowed them to acquire nectar from flowering plants. This morphological innovation, along with other traits, likely promoted the extraordinary diversification of superfamily-level lepidopteran crown groups. The ancestor of butterflies was likely nocturnal, and our results indicate that butterflies became day-flying in the Late Cretaceous (∼98 Ma). Moth hearing organs arose multiple times before the evolutionary arms race between moths and bats, perhaps initially detecting a wide range of sound frequencies before being co-opted to specifically detect bat sonar. Our study provides an essential framework for future comparative studies on butterfly and moth evolution."
245,Ethnic studies increases longer-run academic engagement and attainment,Social Sciences,"Anti-racist curricula and teaching methods are a potentially potent way for schools to better promote a just society and improve educational outcomes for low-income students and students of color. Ethnic studies (ES) courses in K–12 schools are an increasingly common and prominent example of such culturally relevant and critically engaged practice. Proponents tout the benefits of ES for increasing student engagement and academic outcomes, yet there is little causal evidence supporting these claims. In this study, we use a preregistered regression-discontinuity research design to identify the longer-term impacts on educational attainment and engagement of being assigned to an ES course in grade 9. We find that assignment to ES substantially increased high school graduation, attendance, and the probability of enrolling in college.","Increased interest in anti-racist education has motivated the rapidly growing but politically contentious adoption of ethnic studies (ES) courses in US public schools. A long-standing rationale for ES courses is that their emphasis on culturally relevant and critically engaged content (e.g., social justice, anti-racism, stereotypes, contemporary social movements) has potent effects on student engagement and outcomes. However, the quantitative evidence supporting this claim is limited. In this preregistered regression-discontinuity study, we examine the longer-run impact of a grade 9 ES course offered in the San Francisco Unified School District. Our key confirmatory finding is that assignment to this course significantly increased the probability of high school graduation among students near the grade 8 2.0 grade point average (GPA) threshold used for assigning students to the course. Our exploratory analyses also indicate that assignment increased measures of engagement throughout high school (e.g., attendance) as well as the probability of postsecondary matriculation."
246,Gender stereotypes about interests start early and cause gender disparities in computer science and engineering,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Societal stereotypes that girls are less interested than boys in computer science and engineering are endorsed by children and adolescents in a large and socioeconomically diverse sample, across multiple racial/ethnic and gender intersections, and as early as age six (first grade). Gender-interest stereotypes may contribute to subsequent gender disparities in the pursuit of these societally important fields. Addressing interest stereotypes may help improve educational equity.","Societal stereotypes depict girls as less interested than boys in computer science and engineering. We demonstrate the existence of these stereotypes among children and adolescents from first to 12th grade and their potential negative consequences for girls’ subsequent participation in these fields. Studies 1 and 2 (n = 2,277; one preregistered) reveal that children as young as age six (first grade) and adolescents across multiple racial/ethnic and gender intersections (Black, Latinx, Asian, and White girls and boys) endorse stereotypes that girls are less interested than boys in computer science and engineering. The more that individual girls endorse gender-interest stereotypes favoring boys in computer science and engineering, the lower their own interest and sense of belonging in these fields. These gender-interest stereotypes are endorsed even more strongly than gender stereotypes about computer science and engineering abilities. Studies 3 and 4 (n = 172; both preregistered) experimentally demonstrate that 8- to 9-y-old girls are significantly less interested in an activity marked with a gender stereotype (“girls are less interested in this activity than boys”) compared to an activity with no such stereotype (“girls and boys are equally interested in this activity”). Taken together, both ecologically valid real-world studies (Studies 1 and 2) and controlled preregistered laboratory experiments (Studies 3 and 4) reveal that stereotypes that girls are less interested than boys in computer science and engineering emerge early and may contribute to gender disparities."
247,Unbalanced social–ecological acceleration led to state formation failure in early medieval Poland,Anthropology,"To understand the planet’s current crisis, we need in-depth understanding of how social–ecological change accelerated in the past and how it failed or stabilized. Our study contributes to this field by offering detailed evidence of the ecological, economic, social, and political change in a key region of medieval Central Europe, which underwent unprecedented intensification in all of these domains in the 10th c. CE. We show how social and ecological processes accompanied the consolidation of a new political formation, in turn triggered by earlier economic developments. Further, we analyze the new state’s collapse. The success (stabilization) of the acceleration necessitated simultaneous creation or integration of several networks (political, cultural, economic, etc.), which the polity’s elite failed to achieve.","Rapid social–ecological intensification is a recurrent feature of human history. It occurred in different forms and contexts; its outcomes may have been sustainable or transient. Until recently, such intensifications usually accompanied state formation: Consolidation of political power was often coupled with exponential increase in human exploitation of the environment of a given area. Here, we study one such case, uniquely well-documented through our rich paleoecological, archaeological, numismatic, and literary data. Triggered by the Eurasian slave trade, the first “Polish” polity was founded in Central Europe c. 900 common era. It undertook unprecedented ecological intensification in its core territory, connected with large construction projects, and engaged in rapid territorial expansion. We provide new crucial evidence on this process by publishing here a high-resolution pollen profile from a location close to the polity’s capital and by an application of social network analysis to numismatic data. This state collapsed within a few generations after its foundation. The collapse of the political elites, however, did not produce a complete social and ecological disintegration of the polity’s former core region. We thus show how collapse and continuity can remain closely intertwined. Last but not least, the rich evidence on the mechanism of the collapse reveals that successful maintenance of social–ecological intensification requires reliance on a number of cultural, economic, religious, and social networks underlying the political expansion. The polity’s elite lacked access to or failed to mobilize such networks, which led to its demise."
248,Substrate and climate determine terrestrial litter decomposition,Ecology,"Litter decomposition has profound implications for carbon fluxes and nutrient cycling, making it crucial to identify the key factors controlling decomposition rates for ecosystem management and environmental policy. Global litter decomposition rate has historically been hypothesized to be driven by climate. However, by integrating a global dataset from 1,432 terrestrial sites with machine learning approaches, we found that litter substrate and climate determine decomposition rates across spatial and temporal scales, with substrate exerting a stronger direct influence. Future climate change accelerates leaf litter decomposition rates, with smaller effect in low latitudes. Our results highlight the synergistic effect of litter substrate and climate on decomposition rates and have robust implications for modeling terrestrial-atmosphere carbon flux under current and future climate scenarios.","Litter decomposition is a fundamental biogeochemical process for carbon flux and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, yet the global variation in decomposition rates and their covariations with climate and substrate are not fully understood. Here, we synthesized a global dataset of 6,733 independent observations across six continents to illustrate the climatic and substrate controls over litter decomposition. The average decomposition rates of various litter types ranged from 0.74 to 4.01 y−1 across polar to tropics, showing a large geographical span. Litter substrate and climate directly explained 36 and 30% of the variations in decomposition rates, with the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio identified as the best predictor. In the absence of climate variables, litter substrate can effectively explain the variation, while the model’s predictive capacity decreased significantly after litter substrate was excluded. Our synthesis highlights that a fundamental constraint on litter substrate leads to predictable global-scale patterns of terrestrial litter decomposition rates. Integrating litter chemistry parameters should be prioritized for parameter optimization in Earth system models."
249,Motor imagery enhances performance beyond the imagined action,Neuroscience,"Specific cueing movements embedded within a sequence can influence execution and learning of individual segments. We investigated whether the facilitative effect of linked prior movements could also be achieved by imagining the prior movements. Indeed, motor imagery of prior reaching movements allowed motor learning in an established motor adaptation paradigm. Our results go beyond a simple demonstration that motor imagery resembles performance of an actual movement in the brain by showing that imagined movements can also enhance performance of different linked movements. In addition, we show that the strength of neural activity during a basic motor imagery task is associated with motor adaptation. Our results indicate effective use cases of motor imagery in sports and rehabilitation.","Motor imagery is frequently utilized to improve the performance of specific target movements in sports and rehabilitation. In this study, we show that motor imagery can facilitate learning of not only the imagined target movements but also sequentially linked overt movements. Hybrid sequences comprising imagined and physically executed segments allowed participants to learn specific movement characteristics of the executed segments when they were consistently associated with specific imagined segments. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the degree of event-related synchronization in the alpha and beta bands during a basic motor imagery task was correlated with imagery-evoked motor learning. Thus, both behavioral and neural evidence indicate that motor imagery’s benefits extend beyond the imagined movements, improving performance in linked overt movements. This provides decisive evidence for the functional equivalence of imagined and overt movements and suggests applications for imagery in sports and rehabilitation."
250,Mapping secretome-mediated interaction between paired neuron–macrophage single cells,Engineering,"Neuron-immune interaction through secreted factors is the basis for forming the complex microenvironment in the central nervous system that could alter cell functionalities and fates in physiological and pathological conditions. To evaluate the interaction between neurons and immune cells, we used the antibody barcode microchip to profile different secretomes simultaneously from paired neuron–macrophage and neuron–microglia single cells under normal conditions and the amyloid beta protein 1-42 (Aβ1-42)–induced Alzheimer’s disease model, including cytokines, neurotrophic factors, and neuron-derived exosomes. The results uncovered the secretion-mediated secretome network between neurons and immune cells and the complex heterogeneity underlying the secretion from single-neuron cells. These findings deepen our understanding of how neurons and immune cells interact through the complex signaling network, which may help develop diagnostic strategies.","Neuron-immune interaction through secreted factors contributes significantly to the complex microenvironment in the central nervous system that could alter cell functionalities and fates in both physiological and pathological conditions, which remains poorly characterized at the single-cell level. Herein, using a spatially patterned antibody barcode microchip, we realized the mapping of 12 different secretomes, covering cytokines, neurotrophic factors (NFs), and neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from high-throughput, paired single cells (≥ 600) simultaneously under normal conditions and an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model induced with amyloid beta protein 1-42 (Aβ1–42). We applied the platform to analyze the secretion profiles from paired neuron–macrophage and neuron–microglia single cells with human cell lines. We found that pairwise neuron–macrophage interaction would trigger immune responses and attenuate neuron cells’ secretion, while neuron–microglia interaction generally results in opposite outcomes in secretion. When neuron cells are induced with Aβ1–42 protein into the AD model, both neuron–macrophage and neuron–microglia interactions lead to increased cytokines and NDEs and decreased NFs. Further analysis of AD patients’ serum showed that NDEs were significantly higher in patients’ samples than in the control group, validating our observation from the interaction assay. Furthermore, we resolved previously undifferentiated heterogeneity underlying the secretions from single-neuron cells. We found that the NDE and NF secretion was less dependent on the paracrine signaling between one another and that secretions from neuron cells would attenuate after differentiation with Aβ1–42. This study demonstrates the mapping of the different secretomes from paired neuron-immune single cells, providing avenues for understanding how neurons and immune cells interact through the complex secretome network."
251,"Policies, projections, and the social cost of carbon: Results from the DICE-2023 model",Sustainability Science,"The DICE model is the most widely used climate-change integrated assessment model, employed in calculating the social cost of carbon by the US and other governments as well as for creating consistent scenarios and evaluating policies and uncertainties. The present study updates the 2016 DICE version and introduces approaches for including nondiversifiable risk, includes a revised carbon cycle, updates the damage estimates, and includes results on the Paris Accord and temperature-limited scenarios.","The present study examines the assumptions, modeling structure, and results of DICE-2023, the revised Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE), updated to 2023. The revision contains major changes in the treatment of risk, the carbon and climate modules, the treatment of nonindustrial greenhouse gases, discount rates, as well as updates on all the major components. Noteworthy changes are a significant reduction in the target for the optimal (cost-beneficial) temperature path, a lower cost of reaching the 2 °C target, an analysis of the impact of the Paris Accord, and a major increase in the estimated social cost of carbon."
252,BRD9 functions as an HIV-1 latency regulatory factor,Microbiology,"HIV-1 infection remains incurable because of the long-lasting HIV-1-infected latency cells residing in the host. Current treatment strategies are unable to completely eliminate the virus latent reservoirs. Here, we identified bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) as an HIV-1 latency regulator. We found that BRD9 binds to both HIV-1 and host gene regulatory components that collectively modulate HIV-1 latency. BRD9 inhibition induces HIV-1 reactivation in multiple settings including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from people living with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral treatment (ART) and demonstrates synergistic effects with BRD4 inhibition. These findings enhance our understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of HIV-1 latency, which contributes to the development of future latency reversal agents (LRA) regimens for HIV-1 cure.","A major challenge for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) cure is the presence of viral latent reservoirs. The “Shock & Kill” strategy involves the combined use of latency reversal agents (LRA) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) to reactivate HIV-1 latent reservoirs, followed by elimination of infected cells. However, current LRAs are insufficient in fully reactivating the latent reservoirs. Therefore, investigation on novel HIV-1 latency regulators will be crucial to the success of HIV-1 cure research. Here, we identify bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) as an HIV-1 latency regulator. BRD9 inhibition induces HIV-1 latency reactivation in T cell lines, human resting memory CD4+ T cells, and PBMCs derived from people living with HIV-1 (PWH) on ART. BRD9 inhibition, gene depletion, and protein degradation consistently reactivate HIV-1 latency. Moreover, BRD9 inhibition synergizes with BRD4 inhibition in inducing HIV-1 production. Mechanistically, BRD9 binds to HIV-1 LTR promoter and competes with HIV-1 Tat protein for binding to the HIV-1 genome. Additionally, our integrated CUT&RUN DNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and pharmacological analysis revealed downstream host targets of BRD9, including ATAD2 and MTHFD2, that modulate HIV-1 latency."
253,Engineering spin coherence in core-shell diamond nanocrystals,Applied Physical Sciences,"Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond nanocrystals serve as powerful nanoscale quantum sensors, yet they suffer from surface-induced spin decoherence and charge instability that limit their sensitivity. This study demonstrates that an established surface modification using a core-shell design can serve as an approach to enhancing the stability and the coherence of NV centers. The core-shell design significantly increases luminescence, reduces the density of paramagnetic species, and extends NV coherence times by up to 3.5-fold. It represents a robust, scalable, and facile strategy for deploying highly sensitive quantum sensors in complex biological environments. This work provides a foundational advancement in nanoscale quantum sensing, with implications for precision diagnostics, cellular imaging, and other bioengineering applications.","Fluorescent diamond nanocrystals can host spin qubit sensors capable of probing the physical properties of biological systems with nanoscale spatial resolution. Sub-100 nm diamond nanosensors can readily be delivered into intact cells and even living organisms. However, applications beyond current proof-of-principle experiments require a substantial increase in sensitivity, which is limited by surface induced charge instability and electron-spin dephasing. In this work, we utilize engineered core-shell structures to achieve a drastic increase in qubit coherence times (T2) from 1.1 to 35 μs in bare nanodiamonds to upward of 52 to 87 μs. We use electron-paramagnetic-resonance results to present a band bending model and connect silica encapsulation to the removal of deleterious mid-gap surface states that are negatively affecting the qubit’s spin properties. Combined with a 1.9-fold increase in particle luminescence these advances correspond to up to two-order-of-magnitude reduction in integration time. Probing qubit dynamics at a single particle level further reveals that the noise characteristics fundamentally change from a bath with spins that rearrange their spatial configuration during the course of an experiment to a more dilute static bath. The observed results shed light on the underlying mechanisms governing fluorescence and spin properties in diamond nanocrystals and offer an effective noise mitigation strategy based on engineered core-shell structures."
254,Black Lives Matter protests shift public discourse,Social Sciences,This study uses large-scale news media and social media data to show that nationwide Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests occur concurrently with sharp increases in public attention to components of the BLM agenda. We also show that attention to BLM and related concepts is not limited to these brief periods of protest but is sustained after protest has ceased. This suggests that protest events incited a change in public awareness of BLM’s vision of social change and the dissemination of antiracist ideas into popular discourse.,"We show that Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests shift public discourse toward the movement’s agenda, as captured by social media and news reports. We find that BLM protests dramatically amplify the use of terms associated with the BLM agenda throughout the movement’s history. Longitudinal data show that terms denoting the movement’s theoretically distinctive ideas, such as “systemic racism,” receive more attention during waves of protest. We show that these shocks have notable impact beyond intense, or “viral,” periods of nationwide protest. Together, these findings indicate that BLM has successfully leveraged protest events to engender lasting changes in the ways that Americans discuss racial inequality."
255,Gender-diverse teams produce more novel and higher-impact scientific ideas,Social Sciences,"Science teams made up of men and women produce papers that are more novel and highly cited than those of all-men or all-women teams. These performance advantages increase the greater the team’s gender balance and appear nearly universal. On average, they hold for small and large teams, the 45 subfields of medicine, and women- or men-led teams and generalize to published papers in all science fields over the last 20 y. Notwithstanding these benefits, gender-diverse teams remain underrepresented in science when compared to what is expected if the teams in the data had been formed without regard to gender. These findings reveal potentially new gender and teamwork synergies that correlate with scientific discoveries and inform diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.","Science’s changing demographics raise new questions about research team diversity and research outcomes. We study mixed-gender research teams, examining 6.6 million papers published across the medical sciences since 2000 and establishing several core findings. First, the fraction of publications by mixed-gender teams has grown rapidly, yet mixed-gender teams continue to be underrepresented compared to the expectations of a null model. Second, despite their underrepresentation, the publications of mixed-gender teams are substantially more novel and impactful than the publications of same-gender teams of equivalent size. Third, the greater the gender balance on a team, the better the team scores on these performance measures. Fourth, these patterns generalize across medical subfields. Finally, the novelty and impact advantages seen with mixed-gender teams persist when considering numerous controls and potential related features, including fixed effects for the individual researchers, team structures, and network positioning, suggesting that a team’s gender balance is an underrecognized yet powerful correlate of novel and impactful scientific discoveries."
256,Incorporation of polylactic acid microplastics into the carbon cycle as a carbon source to remodel the endogenous metabolism of the gut,Environmental Sciences,"The growing presence of polylactic acid microplastics (PLA-MPs) in aqueous and alimentary contexts has led to increased oral exposure. Understanding primary biological processes of PLA-MPs in the gut is crucial for assessing their potential impact on the host health. We clarified the degradation source of PLA-MPs in the gut and revealed the incorporation of PLA-MPs into the metabolic flux of gut microbiota and epithelial cells as a carbon source in vivo using the 13C isotope tracing technique, thereby entailing a distinct biological fate of biodegradable plastics in mammals.","Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) plastics have been praised as an effective solution to the global pollution caused by petroleum-based plastics, and their widespread use in food packaging and disposable tableware has resulted in increased oral exposure to PLA microplastics (PLA-MPs). Despite their eco-friendly and biodegradable reputation, the in vivo behaviors of PLA-MPs concerning fermentation, carbon cycle, and adverse effects remain unknown. Here, we showed that gut microbiota from the colon can effectively degrade the PLA-MPs by secreting esterase FrsA, whereas esterase FrsA-producing bacteria were identified to dominate this behavior in male C57BL/6 mice. Using isotope tracing and multiomics techniques, we uncovered that 13C-labeled PLA-MPs were incorporated into the carbon cycle of gut microbiota as a carbon source. Meanwhile, these degraded PLA-MPs fragments entered the succinate pathway of the tricarboxylic acid cycle within gut epithelial cells. These processes altered the metabolic phenotype of the gut, resulting in the decreased linear short-chain fatty acids that are primary energy sources of the gut epithelium. Furthermore, we found that exposure of PLA-MPs significantly reduced the appetite and body weight of mice. Our findings present an overall process of biodegradable plastics within hosts, with the focus on the entire double carbon cycle of PLA-MPs in the gut, which offers indispensable insights into the potential impact of exposure to PLA-MPs."
257,Women live longer than men even during severe famines and epidemics,Population Biology,"Women live longer than men in nearly all populations today. Some research focuses on the biological origins of the female advantage; other research stresses the significance of social factors. We studied male–female survival differences in populations of slaves and populations exposed to severe famines and epidemics. We find that even when mortality was very high, women lived longer on average than men. Most of the female advantage was due to differences in mortality among infants: baby girls were able to survive harsh conditions better than baby boys. These results support the view that the female survival advantage is modulated by a complex interaction of biological environmental and social factors.","Women in almost all modern populations live longer than men. Research to date provides evidence for both biological and social factors influencing this gender gap. Conditions when both men and women experience extremely high levels of mortality risk are unexplored sources of information. We investigate the survival of both sexes in seven populations under extreme conditions from famines, epidemics, and slavery. Women survived better than men: In all populations, they had lower mortality across almost all ages, and, with the exception of one slave population, they lived longer on average than men. Gender differences in infant mortality contributed the most to the gender gap in life expectancy, indicating that newborn girls were able to survive extreme mortality hazards better than newborn boys. Our results confirm the ubiquity of a female survival advantage even when mortality is extraordinarily high. The hypothesis that the survival advantage of women has fundamental biological underpinnings is supported by the fact that under very harsh conditions females survive better than males even at infant ages when behavioral and social differences may be minimal or favor males. Our findings also indicate that the female advantage differs across environments and is modulated by social factors."
258,Ferroptosis as a target for protection against cardiomyopathy,Medical Sciences,"Nonapoptotic cell death-induced tissue damage has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorder, inflammation, and stroke. In this study, we demonstrate that ferroptosis, a newly defined iron-dependent cell death, mediates both chemotherapy- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed up-regulation of heme oxygenase 1 by doxorubicin as a major mechanism of ferroptotic cardiomyopathy. As a result, heme oxygenase 1 degrades heme and releases free iron in cardiomyocytes, which in turn leads to generation of oxidized lipids in the mitochondria membrane. Most importantly, both iron chelation therapy and pharmacologically blocking ferroptosis could significantly alleviate cardiomyopathy in mice. These findings suggest targeting ferroptosis as a strategy for treating deadly heart disease.","Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. A key pathogenic factor in the development of lethal heart failure is loss of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. However, mechanisms of cardiomyocyte death remain unclear. Here, we discovered and demonstrated that ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, as a mechanism in murine models of doxorubicin (DOX)- and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiomyopathy. In canonical apoptosis and/or necroptosis-defective Ripk3−/−, Mlkl−/−, or Fadd−/−Mlkl−/− mice, DOX-treated cardiomyocytes showed features of typical ferroptotic cell death. Consistently, compared with dexrazoxane, the only FDA-approved drug for treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 significantly reduced DOX cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing results revealed that heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) was significantly up-regulated in DOX-treated murine hearts. Administering DOX to mice induced cardiomyopathy with a rapid, systemic accumulation of nonheme iron via heme degradation by Nrf2-mediated up-regulation of Hmox1, which effect was abolished in Nrf2-deficent mice. Conversely, zinc protoporphyrin IX, an Hmox1 antagonist, protected the DOX-treated mice, suggesting free iron released on heme degradation is necessary and sufficient to induce cardiac injury. Given that ferroptosis is driven by damage to lipid membranes, we further investigated and found that excess free iron accumulated in mitochondria and caused lipid peroxidation on its membrane. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO significantly rescued DOX cardiomyopathy, supporting oxidative damage of mitochondria as a major mechanism in ferroptosis-induced heart damage. Importantly, ferrostatin-1 and iron chelation also ameliorated heart failure induced by both acute and chronic I/R in mice. These findings highlight that targeting ferroptosis serves as a cardioprotective strategy for cardiomyopathy prevention."
259,"Accurate, scalable, and fully automated inference of species trees from raw genome assemblies using ROADIES",Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Understanding how different species are evolutionarily related is key to addressing fundamental questions in biology and medicine. Scientists use species trees to describe these relationships, and they are typically inferred from genome sequences in modern research using methods that account for the mosaic of histories across the genome. However, while genome assemblies are easily available, species tree inference remains challenging for many researchers because the analysis pipeline demands considerable computing power and domain expertise. To address these barriers, we developed ROADIES—an automated, scalable, and user-friendly tool that infers species trees directly from genome assemblies. ROADIES enables researchers with broad expertise to infer accurate evolutionary trees with ease and efficiency, thus democratizing species tree inference.","Current genome sequencing initiatives across a wide range of life forms offer significant potential to enhance our understanding of evolutionary relationships and support transformative biological and medical applications. Species trees play a central role in many of these applications; however, despite the widespread availability of genome assemblies, accurate inference of species trees remains challenging due to the limited automation, substantial domain expertise, and computational resources required by conventional methods. To address this limitation, we present ROADIES, a fully automated pipeline to infer species trees starting from raw genome assemblies. In contrast to the prominent approach, ROADIES incorporates a unique strategy of randomly sampling segments of the input genomes to generate gene trees. This eliminates the need for predefining a set of loci, limiting the analyses to a fixed number of genes, and performing the cumbersome gene annotation and/or whole genome alignment steps. ROADIES also eliminates the need to infer orthology by leveraging existing discordance-aware methods that allow multicopy genes. Using the genomic datasets from large-scale sequencing efforts across four diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, birds, and budding yeasts), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art studies but in a fraction of the time and effort, including on challenging datasets with rampant gene tree discordance and complex polyploidy. With its speed, accuracy, and automation, ROADIES has the potential to vastly simplify species tree inference, making it accessible to a broader range of scientists and applications."
260,Slowed canonical progress in large fields of science,Social Sciences,"The size of scientific fields may impede the rise of new ideas. Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion. These findings suggest fundamental progress may be stymied if quantitative growth of scientific endeavors—in number of scientists, institutes, and papers—is not balanced by structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas.","In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study."
261,Demographic interactions between the last hunter-gatherers and the first farmers,Anthropology,"Demographic interactions play a pivotal role when two groups compete for the same space and resources, particularly when these interactions result in significant cultural change. We introduce a generalized mathematical model of demographic competition that can be used to explore a wide range of interactions between an incumbent and a migrant group. We demonstrate that when combined with simulation-based generative inference, our theoretical model can be fitted to empirical data. We illustrate the opportunities offered by this approach by investigating three archaeological case studies on the diffusion of farming, shedding light on the role played by population growth rates, cultural assimilation, and competition in shaping the demographic trajectories during the transition to agriculture.","Demographic interaction processes play a pivotal role during episodes of cultural diffusion between different populations, particularly when these episodes can lead to competition for the same resources and geographic space. The diffusion of farming is one prototypical case within this broader scenario, where groups of incumbent hunter-gatherers occupied a space which would later be claimed by expanding farmers. In this work, we tackle such processes through a two-population mathematical model, where farmers and foragers compete and interact in the same geographic space. We present this work as a conceptual approach where, first, we assess the implications of our theoretical model and its general applicability and, second, we empirically test it on three case studies: Denmark, Eastern Iberia, and the island of Kyushu (Japan). While these regional case studies do not encompass the full range of processes observed in the interaction between migrant farmers and incumbent hunter-gatherers they provide reasonable variation to illustrate how our model can be fitted to a diverse range of empirical data and provide insights into these demographic processes. In particular, our theoretical model and case studies illustrate how endogenous interaction processes alone can explain the demographic fluctuations observed in the archaeological record during this transition, highlighting how these should be accounted for before invoking external forces as primary drivers."
262,Symmetries and synchronization from whole-neural activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome: Integration of functional and structural networks,Physics,"Complex biological networks exhibit an intricate relationship between the structural composition of their elements’ interaction and the whole system’s functionality. This is particularly true in neuroscience, where the multiscale organization of neurons gives place to a multitude of hierarchical functionalities responsible for the nervous system interacting with the environment in which it is embedded. In this study, we focus on the chemical synaptic network of the backward-crawling locomotion circuitry of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans to correlate structural clusters of neurons with dynamic patterns of their synchronization. Our findings reveal functional building blocks in the animal’s motor periphery, providing testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior.","Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underlie the synchronization of a system’s units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the Caenorhabditis elegans backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal’s motor periphery, providing testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a door to exploring the structure–function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals."
263,Exploring diverse supramolecular tessellation through hierarchical assemblies of nonalternant nanographene,Chemistry,"The tessellated material is poised to become a fascinating subject in materials science, following the initial exploration of quasicrystals. Specifically, supramolecular tessellation at the molecular level has primarily been observed in macrocyclic molecules. In this study, we utilize a Janus-type nonalternant nanographene with a dynamic skeleton to achieve supramolecular tessellation with fullerene (C60 and C70) in solution, presenting an approach for crafting tessellated materials using nonmacrocyclic compounds exhibiting dynamic conformations.","Tessellation, as an ancient and fascinating mathematical pursuit, has not only captivated mathematicians but also has attracted chemists’ increasing attention at the molecular level in recent years. Exploring tessellation at the molecular scale is pivotal for gaining profound insights into the effects of tessellation on materials and elucidating the essential design principles for supramolecular tessellation. In this study, we develop a dynamic fullerene host (1) with three consecutive heptagons, which promotes diverse supramolecular tessellation via hierarchical assembly. In the solid state, molecule 1 arranges itself into a layered square-shaped tessellation in the crystal superstructure. Interestingly, the co-crystal structures of 1 with C60 and C70 exhibit highly ordered triangular and rhombic tessellation patterns, respectively, due to the adaptive regulation of heptagons with different curved guests, demonstrating the first series of layered tessellated framework in supramolecular fullerene chemistry. This work not only enriches the development of in-solution supramolecular tessellation but also facilitates the rational design of tessellated 2D layered molecular materials"
264,"China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and artisanal cobalt mining from 2000 through 2020",Sustainability Science,"The linkage between abuse to artisanal cobalt miners—including children—in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and use of cobalt in advanced batteries has prompted global supply chain reviews, responsible sourcing initiatives, and research to remove cobalt from battery cathodes. However, no study has systematically evaluated how large of a role artisanal mining plays in world cobalt mine production. Doing so reveals artisanal supply trends and potential monitoring points for artisanal production to help provide more transparent cobalt supply chains. This study finds that artisanal cobalt mining’s share of world cobalt mining has generally decreased since 2008 and that most artisanal production was either processed in the DRC by Chinese firms or exported to China.","From 2000 through 2020, demand for cobalt to manufacture batteries grew 26-fold. Eighty-two percent of this growth occurred in China and China’s cobalt refinery production increased 78-fold. Diminished industrial cobalt mine production in the early-to-mid 2000s led many Chinese companies to purchase ores from artisanal cobalt miners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), many of whom have been found to be children. Despite extensive research on artisanal cobalt mining, fundamental questions about its production remain unanswered. This gap is addressed here by estimating artisanal cobalt production, processing, and trade. The results show that, while total DRC cobalt mine production grew from 11,000 metric tons (t) in 2000 to 98,000 t in 2020, artisanal production only grew from 1,000 to 2,000 t in 2000 to 9,000 to 11,000 t in 2020 (with a peak of 17,000 to 21,000 t in 2018). Artisanal production’s share of world and DRC cobalt mine production peaked around 2008 at 18 to 23% and 40 to 53%, respectively, before trending down to 6 to 8% and 9 to 11% in 2020, respectively. Artisanal production was chiefly exported to China or processed within the DRC by Chinese firms. An average of 72 to 79% of artisanal production was processed at facilities within the DRC from 2016 through 2020. As such, these facilities may be potential monitoring points for artisanal production and its downstream consumers. This finding may help to support responsible sourcing initiatives and better address abuses related to artisanal cobalt mining by focusing local efforts at the artisanal processing facilities through which most artisanal cobalt production flows."
265,Contrastive learning in protein language space predicts interactions between drugs and protein targets,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"In time and money, one of the most expensive steps of the drug discovery pipeline is the experimental screening of small molecules to determine binding to a protein target of interest. Therefore, accurate high-throughput computational prediction of drug-target interactions would unlock significant value, guiding and prioritizing promising candidates for experimental screening. We introduce ConPLex, a machine learning method for predicting drug-target binding which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on many types of targets by using a pretrained protein language model. The approach co-locates the proteins and potential drug molecules in a shared feature space while learning to contrast true drugs from similar nonbinding “decoy” molecules. ConPLex is extremely fast, which allows it to rapidly shortlist candidates for deeper investigation.","Sequence-based prediction of drug–target interactions has the potential to accelerate drug discovery by complementing experimental screens. Such computational prediction needs to be generalizable and scalable while remaining sensitive to subtle variations in the inputs. However, current computational techniques fail to simultaneously meet these goals, often sacrificing performance of one to achieve the others. We develop a deep learning model, ConPLex, successfully leveraging the advances in pretrained protein language models (“PLex”) and employing a protein-anchored contrastive coembedding (“Con”) to outperform state-of-the-art approaches. ConPLex achieves high accuracy, broad adaptivity to unseen data, and specificity against decoy compounds. It makes predictions of binding based on the distance between learned representations, enabling predictions at the scale of massive compound libraries and the human proteome. Experimental testing of 19 kinase-drug interaction predictions validated 12 interactions, including four with subnanomolar affinity, plus a strongly binding EPHB1 inhibitor (KD = 1.3 nM). Furthermore, ConPLex embeddings are interpretable, which enables us to visualize the drug–target embedding space and use embeddings to characterize the function of human cell-surface proteins. We anticipate that ConPLex will facilitate efficient drug discovery by making highly sensitive in silico drug screening feasible at the genome scale. ConPLex is available open source at https://ConPLex.csail.mit.edu."
266,Leveraging AI for democratic discourse: Chat interventions can improve online political conversations at scale,Computer Sciences,"We develop an AI chat assistant that makes real-time, evidence-based suggestions for messages in divisive online political conversations. In a randomized controlled trial, we show that when one participant in a conversation had access to this assistant, it increased their partner’s reported quality of conversation and both participants’ willingness to grant political opponents space to express and advocate their views in the public sphere. Participants had the ability to accept, modify, or ignore the AI chat assistant’s recommendations. Notably, participants’ policy positions were unchanged by the intervention. Though many are rightly concerned about the role of AI sowing social division, our findings suggest it can do the opposite—improve political conversations without manipulating participants’ views.","Political discourse is the soul of democracy, but misunderstanding and conflict can fester in divisive conversations. The widespread shift to online discourse exacerbates many of these problems and corrodes the capacity of diverse societies to cooperate in solving social problems. Scholars and civil society groups promote interventions that make conversations less divisive or more productive, but scaling these efforts to online discourse is challenging. We conduct a large-scale experiment that demonstrates how online conversations about divisive topics can be improved with AI tools. Specifically, we employ a large language model to make real-time, evidence-based recommendations intended to improve participants’ perception of feeling understood. These interventions improve reported conversation quality, promote democratic reciprocity, and improve the tone, without systematically changing the content of the conversation or moving people’s policy attitudes."
267,Independent transitions to fully planktonic life cycles shaped the global distribution of medusozoans in the epipelagic zone,Evolution,"Medusozoan jellyfish are well known for their impact on coastal ecosystems, often linked to their complex life cycles, which include benthic polyp and pelagic medusa stages. Several lesser-known medusozoan groups evolved a holoplanktonic (entirely pelagic) life cycle by either losing the polyp stage or developing polyp forms that drift, float, or parasitize pelagic organisms. By analyzing data from the Tara Oceans expedition within a phylogenetic framework, we found that each of these evolutionary transitions was linked to the colonization of offshore habitats and the emergence of species prevailing in most coastal and offshore regions, leading holoplanktonic medusozoans to predominate at the global scale. Life cycle evolution has shaped the distribution of medusozoans and influenced their potential response to environmental changes.","Life history traits influence marine species dispersal and habitat colonization. Medusozoans (jellyfish and siphonophores) exhibit diverse life cycles, evolved from an ancestral cycle alternating between a benthic polyp and a pelagic medusa. Despite their ecological importance, factors shaping medusozoan distribution remain poorly understood. By integrating metabarcoding and environmental data from the Tara Oceans expedition with life history traits, we provide global evidence supporting the longstanding hypothesis that benthic polyp presence/absence is a key factor influencing the distribution and abundance of planktonic medusozoans in the surface ocean. We inferred on a time-calibrated phylogeny of Medusozoa multiple transitions to a fully planktonic (holoplanktonic) life cycle, either through polyp loss, acquisition of drifting polyps, or development of polyps parasitizing pelagic organisms. We could associate each transition with a shift toward offshore habitats and the emergence of globally dominant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), whose abundance far exceeds that of any nonholoplanktonic medusozoans in the planktonic realm. The prevalence of holoplanktonic medusozoans in terms of abundance and diversity is broadly observed in coastal and offshore environments, peaking over greater bathymetric depths in tropical and subtropical regions. We show that holoplanktonic and nonholoplanktonic groups interact with distinct yet compositionally similar planktonic communities. Holoplanktonic OTUs occupy more peripheral positions in a plankton interactome, suggesting greater flexibility in biotic interactions, an adaptive trait in rapidly changing planktonic ecosystems. These findings highlight how life cycle evolution shaped the global distribution of medusozoans and suggest that variations in life history may significantly influence how medusozoans respond to global environmental changes."
268,RORγt-expressing dendritic cells are functionally versatile and evolutionarily conserved antigen-presenting cells,Immunology and Inflammation,"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate T cell immunity. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt)-expressing APCs are heterogenous regulators of T cell tolerance but their subtypes and lineage relationships are ill-defined. We report that RORγt+ dendritic cells (DCs) are evolutionarily conserved, exhibit wide tissue distribution and reconcile various RORγt+ APC populations known to promote peripheral T cell tolerance. We show that RORγt+ DCs can sense pathogens, migrate to lymph nodes, activate naïve CD4+ T cells, and accumulate in demyelinating neuroinflammation with a proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, RORγt+ DCs have a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment. This highlights their therapeutic potential and their affiliation with DCs.","Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that integrate signals from their environment allowing them to direct situation-adapted immunity. Thereby they harbor great potential for being targeted in vaccination, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here, we use fate mapping, functional analyses, and comparative cross-species transcriptomics to show that RORγt+ DCs are a conserved, functionally versatile, and transcriptionally distinct type of DCs. RORγt+ DCs entail various populations described in different contexts including Janus cells/RORγt-expressing extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), subtypes of Thetis cells, RORγt+-DC (R-DC) like cells, cDC2C and ACY3+ DCs. We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt+ DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4+ T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt+ DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt+ DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men. Thus, our work establishes RORγt+ DCs as immune sentinel cells that exhibit a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing peripheral T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment."
269,Rapid growth of the US wildland-urban interface raises wildfire risk,Environmental Sciences,"When houses are built close to forests or other types of natural vegetation, they pose two problems related to wildfires. First, there will be more wildfires due to human ignitions. Second, wildfires that occur will pose a greater risk to lives and homes, they will be hard to fight, and letting natural fires burn becomes impossible. We examined the number of houses that have been built since 1990 in the United States in or near natural vegetation, in an area known as the wildland-urban interface (WUI), and found that a large number of houses have been built there. Approximately one in three houses and one in ten hectares are now in the WUI. These WUI growth trends will exacerbate wildfire problems in the future.","The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is the area where houses and wildland vegetation meet or intermingle, and where wildfire problems are most pronounced. Here we report that the WUI in the United States grew rapidly from 1990 to 2010 in terms of both number of new houses (from 30.8 to 43.4 million; 41% growth) and land area (from 581,000 to 770,000 km2; 33% growth), making it the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States. The vast majority of new WUI areas were the result of new housing (97%), not related to an increase in wildland vegetation. Within the perimeter of recent wildfires (1990–2015), there were 286,000 houses in 2010, compared with 177,000 in 1990. Furthermore, WUI growth often results in more wildfire ignitions, putting more lives and houses at risk. Wildfire problems will not abate if recent housing growth trends continue."
270,Biparental Inheritance of Mitochondrial DNA in Humans,Genetics,"The energy-producing organelle mitochondrion contains its own compact genome, which is separate from the nuclear genome. In nearly all mammals, this mitochondrial genome is inherited exclusively from the mother, and transmission of paternal mitochondria or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been convincingly demonstrated in humans. In this paper, we have uncovered multiple instances of biparental inheritance of mtDNA spanning three unrelated multiple generation families, a result confirmed by independent sequencing across multiple unrelated laboratories with different methodologies. Surprisingly, this pattern of inheritance appears to be determined in an autosomal dominantlike manner. This paper profoundly alters a widespread belief about mitochondrial inheritance and potentially opens a novel field in mitochondrial medicine.","Although there has been considerable debate about whether paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transmission may coexist with maternal transmission of mtDNA, it is generally believed that mitochondria and mtDNA are exclusively maternally inherited in humans. Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. Elucidating the molecular mechanism for this unusual mode of inheritance will provide new insights into how mtDNA is passed on from parent to offspring and may even lead to the development of new avenues for the therapeutic treatment for pathogenic mtDNA transmission."
271,A higher-order theory of emotional consciousness,Neuroscience,"Although emotions, or feelings, are the most significant events in our lives, there has been relatively little contact between theories of emotion and emerging theories of consciousness in cognitive science. In this paper we challenge the conventional view, which argues that emotions are innately programmed in subcortical circuits, and propose instead that emotions are higher-order states instantiated in cortical circuits. What differs in emotional and nonemotional experiences, we argue, is not that one originates subcortically and the other cortically, but instead the kinds of inputs processed by the cortical network. We offer modifications of higher-order theory, a leading theory of consciousness, to allow higher-order theory to account for self-awareness, and then extend this model to account for conscious emotional experiences.","Emotional states of consciousness, or what are typically called emotional feelings, are traditionally viewed as being innately programmed in subcortical areas of the brain, and are often treated as different from cognitive states of consciousness, such as those related to the perception of external stimuli. We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain. In this view, what differs in emotional and nonemotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences. Although subcortical circuits are not directly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences. In building the case for this proposal, we defend a modified version of what is known as the higher-order theory of consciousness."
272,No evidence for Peto’s paradox in terrestrial vertebrates,Evolution,"Peto’s paradox—the puzzling disconnect between body size and cancer prevalence across species—has long stood as one of comparative biology’s most captivating and unresolved enigmas. Through the application of advanced phylogenetic comparative methods, we reveal that empirical evidence does not support Peto’s paradox across the four major classes of terrestrial vertebrates: Larger species do, in fact, face higher cancer prevalence than their smaller counterparts. Furthermore, we show that as variation in body size has evolved in birds and mammals, it has also driven the evolution of enhanced cellular growth control. This adaptation allows species to grow larger over time without experiencing the anticipated cancer burden associated with their size.","Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses."
273,Antibody reactivity against EBNA1 and GlialCAM differentiates multiple sclerosis patients from healthy controls,Immunology and Inflammation,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the brain and spinal cord, leading to disability in young adults. Infection with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a prerequisite for developing the disease. We previously demonstrated that antibody responses against the virus protein EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) cross-react with brain proteins of MS patients and contribute to the disease. Here, we confirm in a large cohort of MS patients and controls that the presence of these antibodies increases the risk for MS, and we correlate them with the major genetic risk factor for MS. A combination of multiple antibodies and the genetic risk factor increases the risk for MS in an additive fashion.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is linked to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, preceding the disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology."
274,Climate migration amplifies demographic change and population aging,Sustainability Science,"We project climate migration driven by sea-level rise through 2100 in the United States, incorporating fertility and gravity effects to capture secondary population processes, which we call “demographic amplification.” Failure to include these indirect effects underestimates the demographic impact of climate migration. The demographic amplification of climate migrants results in 5.3 and 18 times the number of migrants. Because migration is most likely to occur in more youthful populations, areas experiencing accelerated climate out-migration could face accelerated population aging. In both origins and destinations, policies addressing sustainable growth management such as access to affordable housing, aging services, future public health needs, and infrastructure planning should incorporate demographic amplification to fully anticipate population changes and build a more sustainable future.","The warnings of potential climate migration first appeared in the scientific literature in the late 1970s when increased recognition that disintegrating ice sheets could drive people to migrate from coastal cities. Since that time, scientists have modeled potential climate migration without integrating other population processes, potentially obscuring the demographic amplification of this migration. Climate migration could amplify demographic change—enhancing migration to destinations and suppressing migration to origins. Additionally, older populations are the least likely to migrate, and climate migration could accelerate population aging in origin areas. Here, we investigate climate migration under sea-level rise (SLR), a single climatic hazard, and examine both the potential demographic amplification effect and population aging by combining matrix population models, flood hazard models, and a migration model built on 40 y of environmental migration in the United States to project the US population distribution of US counties. We find that the demographic amplification of SLR for all feasible Representative Concentration Pathway-Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (RCP–SSP) scenarios in 2100 ranges between 8.6–28 M [5.7–53 M]—5.3 and 18 times the number of migrants (0.4–10 M). We also project significant aging of coastal areas as youthful populations migrate but older populations remain, accelerating population aging in origin areas. As the percentage of the population lost due to climate migration increases, the median age also increases—up to 10+ y older in some highly impacted coastal counties. Additionally, our population projection approach can be easily adapted to investigate additional or multiple climate hazards."
275,Cognitive and noncognitive predictors of success,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"To examine cognitive and noncognitive predictors of success, we conducted a megaanalysis of prospective, longitudinal data on over 10,000 cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point. Cognitive ability was negatively related to physical ability and grit. While cognitive ability predicted academic and military grades, the noncognitive attributes of physical ability and grit were more prognostic of other achievement outcomes, including successful completion of initiation training and 4-y graduation.","When predicting success, how important are personal attributes other than cognitive ability? To address this question, we capitalized on a full decade of prospective, longitudinal data from n = 11,258 cadets entering training at the US Military Academy at West Point. Prior to training, cognitive ability was negatively correlated with both physical ability and grit. Cognitive ability emerged as the strongest predictor of academic and military grades, but noncognitive attributes were more prognostic of other achievement outcomes, including successful completion of initiation training and 4-y graduation. We conclude that noncognitive aspects of human capital deserve greater attention from both scientists and practitioners interested in predicting real-world success."
276,Learning loss due to school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic,Social Sciences,"School closures have been a common tool in the battle against COVID-19. Yet, their costs and benefits remain insufficiently known. We use a natural experiment that occurred as national examinations in The Netherlands took place before and after lockdown to evaluate the impact of school closures on students’ learning. The Netherlands is interesting as a “best-case” scenario, with a short lockdown, equitable school funding, and world-leading rates of broadband access. Despite favorable conditions, we find that students made little or no progress while learning from home. Learning loss was most pronounced among students from disadvantaged homes.","Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n  350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures."
277,The effects of Facebook and Instagram on the 2020 election: A deactivation experiment,Social Sciences,"We provide the largest-scale evidence available to date on the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in a presidential election season. This study is part of the U.S. 2020 Facebook and Instagram Election Study, a unique collaboration between academics and researchers at Meta that allowed unprecedented access to Meta platform data and algorithms while also including extensive safeguards to guarantee the integrity of the research.","We study the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political beliefs, attitudes, and behavior by randomizing a subset of 19,857 Facebook users and 15,585 Instagram users to deactivate their accounts for 6 wk before the 2020 U.S. election. We report four key findings. First, both Facebook and Instagram deactivation reduced an index of political participation (driven mainly by reduced participation online). Second, Facebook deactivation had no significant effect on an index of knowledge, but secondary analyses suggest that it reduced knowledge of general news while possibly also decreasing belief in misinformation circulating online. Third, Facebook deactivation may have reduced self-reported net votes for Trump, though this effect does not meet our preregistered significance threshold. Finally, the effects of both Facebook and Instagram deactivation on affective and issue polarization, perceived legitimacy of the election, candidate favorability, and voter turnout were all precisely estimated and close to zero."
278,Assessing agricultural risks of climate change in the 21st century in a global gridded crop model intercomparison,Agricultural Sciences,"Agriculture is arguably the sector most affected by climate change, but assessments differ and are thus difficult to compare. We provide a globally consistent, protocol-based, multimodel climate change assessment for major crops with explicit characterization of uncertainty. Results with multimodel agreement indicate strong negative effects from climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes where developing countries are concentrated. Simulations that consider explicit nitrogen stress result in much more severe impacts from climate change, with implications for adaptation planning.","Here we present the results from an intercomparison of multiple global gridded crop models (GGCMs) within the framework of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project. Results indicate strong negative effects of climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at low latitudes; models that include explicit nitrogen stress project more severe impacts. Across seven GGCMs, five global climate models, and four representative concentration pathways, model agreement on direction of yield changes is found in many major agricultural regions at both low and high latitudes; however, reducing uncertainty in sign of response in mid-latitude regions remains a challenge. Uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and high temperature effects demonstrated here show that further research is urgently needed to better understand effects of climate change on agricultural production and to devise targeted adaptation strategies."
279,Universal healthcare as pandemic preparedness: The lives and costs that could have been saved during the COVID-19 pandemic,Economic Sciences,"The fragmented and inefficient healthcare system in the United States leads to many preventable deaths and unnecessary costs every year. Universal healthcare could have alleviated the mortality caused by a confluence of negative COVID-related factors. Incorporating the demography of the uninsured with age-specific COVID-19 and nonpandemic mortality, we estimated that a single-payer universal healthcare system would have saved 212,000 lives in 2020 alone. We also calculated that US$105.6 billion of medical expenses associated with COVID-19 hospitalization could have been averted by a Medicare for All system.","The fragmented and inefficient healthcare system in the United States leads to many preventable deaths and unnecessary costs every year. During a pandemic, the lives saved and economic benefits of a single-payer universal healthcare system relative to the status quo would be even greater. For Americans who are uninsured and underinsured, financial barriers to COVID-19 care delayed diagnosis and exacerbated transmission. Concurrently, deaths beyond COVID-19 accrued from the background rate of uninsurance. Universal healthcare would alleviate the mortality caused by the confluence of these factors. To evaluate the repercussions of incomplete insurance coverage in 2020, we calculated the elevated mortality attributable to the loss of employer-sponsored insurance and to background rates of uninsurance, summing with the increased COVID-19 mortality due to low insurance coverage. Incorporating the demography of the uninsured with age-specific COVID-19 and nonpandemic mortality, we estimated that a single-payer universal healthcare system would have saved about 212,000 lives in 2020 alone. We also calculated that US$105.6 billion of medical expenses associated with COVID-19 hospitalization could have been averted by a single-payer universal healthcare system over the course of the pandemic. These economic benefits are in addition to US$438 billion expected to be saved by single-payer universal healthcare during a nonpandemic year."
280,Nutrient and moisture limitations reveal keystone metabolites linking rhizosphere metabolomes and microbiomes,Microbiology,"Plants and microorganisms release metabolites that mediate rhizosphere host–microbe interactions and modulate plant adaptation to environmental stresses. However, the mechanisms underlying rhizosphere metabolite-microbiome dynamics and their functional and biological significance are largely unknown. Our study reveals that certain classes of rhizosphere metabolites exhibit a response to abiotic stressors and are linked to changes in the rhizosphere microbial community and plant phenotypes. We propose that a group of underinvestigated rhizosphere compounds can act as keystone metabolites, impacting the composition of the rhizosphere microbiome and potentially modulating plant metabolism in response to nutrient availability. These findings demonstrate the tremendous potential of harnessing plant–metabolite–microbe interactions to optimize rhizosphere microbiome function, promote plant and ecosystem health, and offer broad avenues for soil microbiome research.","Plants release a wealth of metabolites into the rhizosphere that can shape the composition and activity of microbial communities in response to environmental stress. The connection between rhizodeposition and rhizosphere microbiome succession has been suggested, particularly under environmental stress conditions, yet definitive evidence is scarce. In this study, we investigated the relationship between rhizosphere chemistry, microbiome dynamics, and abiotic stress in the bioenergy crop switchgrass grown in a marginal soil under nutrient-limited, moisture-limited, and nitrogen (N)-replete, phosphorus (P)-replete, and NP-replete conditions. We combined 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics to link rhizosphere microbial communities and metabolites. We identified significant changes in rhizosphere metabolite profiles in response to abiotic stress and linked them to changes in microbial communities using network analysis. N-limitation amplified the abundance of aromatic acids, pentoses, and their derivatives in the rhizosphere, and their enhanced availability was linked to the abundance of bacterial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Alphaproteobacteria. Conversely, N-amended conditions increased the availability of N-rich rhizosphere compounds, which coincided with proliferation of Actinobacteria. Treatments with contrasting N availability differed greatly in the abundance of potential keystone metabolites; serotonin and ectoine were particularly abundant in N-replete soils, while chlorogenic, cinnamic, and glucuronic acids were enriched in N-limited soils. Serotonin, the keystone metabolite we identified with the largest number of links to microbial taxa, significantly affected root architecture and growth of rhizosphere microorganisms, highlighting its potential to shape microbial community and mediate rhizosphere plant–microbe interactions."
281,Gender stereotypes about interests start early and cause gender disparities in computer science and engineering,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Societal stereotypes that girls are less interested than boys in computer science and engineering are endorsed by children and adolescents in a large and socioeconomically diverse sample, across multiple racial/ethnic and gender intersections, and as early as age six (first grade). Gender-interest stereotypes may contribute to subsequent gender disparities in the pursuit of these societally important fields. Addressing interest stereotypes may help improve educational equity.","Societal stereotypes depict girls as less interested than boys in computer science and engineering. We demonstrate the existence of these stereotypes among children and adolescents from first to 12th grade and their potential negative consequences for girls’ subsequent participation in these fields. Studies 1 and 2 (n = 2,277; one preregistered) reveal that children as young as age six (first grade) and adolescents across multiple racial/ethnic and gender intersections (Black, Latinx, Asian, and White girls and boys) endorse stereotypes that girls are less interested than boys in computer science and engineering. The more that individual girls endorse gender-interest stereotypes favoring boys in computer science and engineering, the lower their own interest and sense of belonging in these fields. These gender-interest stereotypes are endorsed even more strongly than gender stereotypes about computer science and engineering abilities. Studies 3 and 4 (n = 172; both preregistered) experimentally demonstrate that 8- to 9-y-old girls are significantly less interested in an activity marked with a gender stereotype (“girls are less interested in this activity than boys”) compared to an activity with no such stereotype (“girls and boys are equally interested in this activity”). Taken together, both ecologically valid real-world studies (Studies 1 and 2) and controlled preregistered laboratory experiments (Studies 3 and 4) reveal that stereotypes that girls are less interested than boys in computer science and engineering emerge early and may contribute to gender disparities."
282,Light exposure during sleep impairs cardiometabolic function,Medical Sciences,"Ambient nighttime light exposure is implicated as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, including cardiometabolic disease. However, the effects of nighttime light exposure during sleep on cardiometabolic outcomes and the related mechanisms are unclear. This laboratory study shows that, in healthy adults, one night of moderate (100 lx) light exposure during sleep increases nighttime heart rate, decreases heart rate variability (higher sympathovagal balance), and increases next-morning insulin resistance when compared to sleep in a dimly lit (<3 lx) environment. Moreover, a positive relationship between higher sympathovagal balance and insulin levels suggests that sympathetic activation may play a role in the observed light-induced changes in insulin sensitivity.","This study tested the hypothesis that acute exposure to light during nighttime sleep adversely affects next-morning glucose homeostasis and whether this effect occurs via reduced sleep quality, melatonin suppression, or sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation during sleep. A total of 20 young adults participated in this parallel-group study design. The room light condition (n = 10) included one night of sleep in dim light (<3 lx) followed by one night of sleep with overhead room lighting (100 lx). The dim light condition (n = 10) included two consecutive nights of sleep in dim light. Measures of insulin resistance (morning homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, 30-min insulin area under the curve [AUC] from a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test) were higher in the room light versus dim light condition. Melatonin levels were similar in both conditions. In the room light condition, participants spent proportionately more time in stage N2 and less in slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep. Heart rate was higher and heart rate variability lower (higher sympathovagal balance) during sleep in the room light versus the dim light condition. Importantly, the higher sympathovagal balance during sleep was associated with higher 30-min insulin AUC, consistent with increased insulin resistance the following morning. These results demonstrate that a single night of exposure to room light during sleep can impair glucose homeostasis, potentially via increased SNS activation. Attention to avoiding exposure to light at night during sleep may be beneficial for cardiometabolic health."
283,Observing many researchers using the same data and hypothesis reveals a hidden universe of uncertainty,Social Sciences,"Will different researchers converge on similar findings when analyzing the same data? Seventy-three independent research teams used identical cross-country survey data to test a prominent social science hypothesis: that more immigration will reduce public support for government provision of social policies. Instead of convergence, teams’ results varied greatly, ranging from large negative to large positive effects of immigration on social policy support. The choices made by the research teams in designing their statistical tests explain very little of this variation; a hidden universe of uncertainty remains. Considering this variation, scientists, especially those working with the complexities of human societies and behavior, should exercise humility and strive to better account for the uncertainty in their work.","This study explores how researchers’ analytical choices affect the reliability of scientific findings. Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers’ expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team’s workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers’ results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings."
284,Reinforcement learning–based adaptive strategies for climate change adaptation: An application for coastal flood risk management,"Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences","Traditional risk management frameworks are inadequate for long-term climate adaptation, given the substantial uncertainty in climate projections. The study highlights the strong potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in modeling and informing adaptive climate decision-making. Focusing on coastal flood protection strategies for Manhattan in New York City that incorporate continuous observations of sea-level rise, the study demonstrates RL-based designs’ substantial cost-reduction ability compared to conventional numerical methods. Moreover, it manifests RL’s ability to handle complex policy designs, extreme economic losses, potential expert misjudgment, and, more broadly, the critical role of systematic learning and updating in climate change adaptation.","Conventional computational models of climate adaptation frameworks inadequately consider decision-makers’ capacity to learn, update, and improve decisions. Here, we investigate the potential of reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning technique that efficaciously acquires knowledge from the environment and systematically optimizes dynamic decisions, in modeling and informing adaptive climate decision-making. We consider coastal flood risk mitigations for Manhattan, New York City, USA (NYC), illustrating the benefit of continuously incorporating observations of sea-level rise into systematic designs of adaptive strategies. We find that when designing adaptive seawalls to protect NYC, the RL-derived strategy significantly reduces the expected net cost by 6 to 36% under the moderate emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 (9 to 77% under the high emissions scenario SSP5-8.5), compared to conventional methods. When considering multiple adaptive policies, including accomodation and retreat as well as protection, the RL approach leads to a further 5% (15%) cost reduction, showing RL’s flexibility in coordinatively addressing complex policy design problems. RL also outperforms conventional methods in controlling tail risk (i.e., low probability, high impact outcomes) and in avoiding losses induced by misinformation about the climate state (e.g., deep uncertainty), demonstrating the importance of systematic learning and updating in addressing extremes and uncertainties related to climate adaptation."
285,A skin-interfaced wireless wearable device and data analytics approach for sleep-stage and disorder detection,Engineering,"This work introduces an approach to continuous sleep monitoring using low-power multimodal mechanoacoustic (LMA) sensors. Unlike traditional sleep diagnostics and existing wearable technologies, LMA directly measures respiratory biomarkers. The systematic signal processing pipeline extracts features of activities, respiratory and heart rate variability, essential for detecting sleep stages and disorders. Paired with an interpretable machine learning (ML) model, LMA-SleepNet, this approach delivers accurate, generalized, and personalized sleep analysis. Its superior performance in distinguishing sleep stages and apnea events highlights the translational potential of this technology for continuous sleep monitoring in both clinical and home settings, offering broad applicability across diverse populations.","Accurate identification of sleep stages and disorders is crucial for maintaining health, preventing chronic conditions, and improving diagnosis and treatment. Direct respiratory measurements, as key biomarkers, are missing in traditional wrist- or finger-worn wearables, which thus limit their precision in detection of sleep stages and sleep disorders. By contrast, this work introduces a simple, multimodal, skin-integrated, energy-efficient mechanoacoustic sensor capable of synchronized cardiac and respiratory measurements. The mechanical design enhances sensitivity and durability, enabling continuous, wireless monitoring of essential vital signs (respiration rate, heart rate and corresponding variability, temperature) and various physical activities. Systematic physiology-based analytics involving explainable machine learning allows both precise sleep characterization and transparent tracking of each factor’s contribution, demonstrating the dominance of respiration, as validated through a diverse range of human subjects, both healthy and with sleep disorders. This methodology enables cost-effective, clinical-quality sleep tracking with minimal user effort, suitable for home and clinical use."
286,Induced B cell receptor diversity predicts PD-1 blockade immunotherapy response,Medical Sciences,"Checkpoint blockade has transformed cancer immunotherapy, but many patients do not respond clinically. In this work, we longitudinally profile a cohort of patients with locally advanced skin cancers before, during, and after checkpoint blockade. By tracking single-cell and spatial immunoreceptor sequences and transcriptome in both multiple tumor biopsies and the draining lymph nodes, we found that anti-Programmed Death (aPD)-1 induced B cell clonal diversity is critical for T cell expansion, activation, and significantly improved patient overall survival. This dataset is one of the most comprehensive and informative datasets for human cancer immunotherapy, as paired tumor biopsies and on-therapy lymph node biopsies are extremely important but rare.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-Programmed Death-1 antibodies (aPD-1) can be effective in treating advanced cancers. However, many patients do not respond, and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially colocalize with T cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD-1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We find that pretreatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders."
287,Linking plasma formation in grapes to microwave resonances of aqueous dimers,Applied Physical Sciences,"In a popular parlor trick, plasma is created by irradiating grape hemispheres in a household microwave oven. This work ties the source of the plasma to microwave photonic hotspots at the junction of aqueous dielectric spherical dimers. We use a combination of thermal-imaging techniques and computer simulations to show that grape-sized fruit and hydrogel beads form resonant cavities that concentrate electromagnetic fields to extreme subwavelength regions. This is enabled by the large dielectric susceptibility of water at microwave frequencies. Furthermore, the absorptive properties of water are key to washing out complex internal modes and for allowing the evanescent hotspot build-up. Our approach to microwave resonances in high-dielectric materials opens a sandbox for nanocluster photonics research.","The sparking of cut grape hemispheres in a household microwave oven has been a poorly explained Internet parlor trick for over two decades. By expanding this phenomenon to whole spherical dimers of various grape-sized fruit and hydrogel water beads, we demonstrate that the formation of plasma is due to electromagnetic hotspots arising from the cooperative interaction of Mie resonances in the individual spheres. The large dielectric constant of water at the relevant gigahertz frequencies can be used to form systems that mimic surface plasmon resonances that are typically reserved for nanoscale metallic objects. The absorptive properties of water furthermore act to homogenize higher-mode profiles and to preferentially select evanescent field concentrations such as the axial hotspot. Thus, beyond providing an explanation for a popular-science phenomenon, we outline a method to experimentally model subwavelength field patterns using thermal imaging in macroscopic dielectric systems."
288,Greatly enhanced risk to humans as a consequence of empirically determined lower moist heat stress tolerance,Environmental Sciences,"Increased heat and humidity potentially threaten people and societies. Here, we incorporate our laboratory-measured, physiologically based wet-bulb temperature thresholds across a range of air temperatures and relative humidities, to project future heat stress risk from bias-corrected climate model output. These vulnerability thresholds substantially increase the calculated risk of widespread potentially dangerous, uncompensable humid heat stress. Some of the most populated regions, typically lower-middle income countries in the moist tropics and subtropics, violate this threshold well before 3 °C of warming. Further global warming increases the extent of threshold crossing into drier regions, e.g., in North America and the Middle East. These differentiated patterns imply vastly different heat adaption strategies. Limiting warming to under 2 °C nearly eliminates this risk.","As heatwaves become more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting due to climate change, the question of breaching thermal limits becomes pressing. A wet-bulb temperature (Tw) of 35 °C has been proposed as a theoretical upper limit on human abilities to biologically thermoregulate. But, recent—empirical—research using human subjects found a significantly lower maximum Tw at which thermoregulation is possible even with minimal metabolic activity. Projecting future exposure to this empirical critical environmental limit has not been done. Here, using this more accurate threshold and the latest coupled climate model results, we quantify exposure to dangerous, potentially lethal heat for future climates at various global warming levels. We find that humanity is more vulnerable to moist heat stress than previously proposed because of these lower thermal limits. Still, limiting warming to under 2 °C nearly eliminates exposure and risk of widespread uncompensable moist heatwaves as a sharp rise in exposure occurs at 3 °C of warming. Parts of the Middle East and the Indus River Valley experience brief exceedances with only 1.5 °C warming. More widespread, but brief, dangerous heat stress occurs in a +2 °C climate, including in eastern China and sub-Saharan Africa, while the US Midwest emerges as a moist heat stress hotspot in a +3 °C climate. In the future, moist heat extremes will lie outside the bounds of past human experience and beyond current heat mitigation strategies for billions of people. While some physiological adaptation from the thresholds described here is possible, additional behavioral, cultural, and technical adaptation will be required to maintain healthy lifestyles."
289,Psychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology,Cell Biology,"Psychosocial experiences predict health trajectories, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We report that positive psychosocial experiences are linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial energy transformation machinery, whereas negative experiences are linked to lower abundance. Overall, psychosocial experiences accounted for 18 to 25% of the variance in protein abundance for complex I, the largest and most upstream mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) enzyme. At single-cell resolution, positive psychosocial experiences were particularly related to glial cell mitochondrial phenotypes. As a result, opposite associations between glial cells and neurons were naturally masked in bulk transcriptomic analyses. Our results suggest that mitochondrial recalibrations in specific brain cell types may represent a potential psychobiological pathway linking psychosocial experiences to human brain health.","Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these “mind-mitochondria” associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes."
290,The effects of Facebook and Instagram on the 2020 election: A deactivation experiment,Social Sciences,"We provide the largest-scale evidence available to date on the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in a presidential election season. This study is part of the U.S. 2020 Facebook and Instagram Election Study, a unique collaboration between academics and researchers at Meta that allowed unprecedented access to Meta platform data and algorithms while also including extensive safeguards to guarantee the integrity of the research.","We study the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political beliefs, attitudes, and behavior by randomizing a subset of 19,857 Facebook users and 15,585 Instagram users to deactivate their accounts for 6 wk before the 2020 U.S. election. We report four key findings. First, both Facebook and Instagram deactivation reduced an index of political participation (driven mainly by reduced participation online). Second, Facebook deactivation had no significant effect on an index of knowledge, but secondary analyses suggest that it reduced knowledge of general news while possibly also decreasing belief in misinformation circulating online. Third, Facebook deactivation may have reduced self-reported net votes for Trump, though this effect does not meet our preregistered significance threshold. Finally, the effects of both Facebook and Instagram deactivation on affective and issue polarization, perceived legitimacy of the election, candidate favorability, and voter turnout were all precisely estimated and close to zero."
291,Learning the language of antibody hypervariability,Biophysics and Computational Biology,"Antibodies are crucial in therapeutics and immune defense, but their hypervariable regions pose challenges for computational modeling. We introduce Antibody Mutagenesis-Augmented Processing (AbMAP), a transfer learning framework that adapts foundational protein language models to antibody-specific tasks. AbMAP focuses on the hypervariable regions, employing contrastive augmentation and multitask learning to capture both structural and functional properties. This approach significantly improves prediction accuracy for various antibody properties, including antigen binding and paratope identification. AbMAP demonstrates high efficiency in antibody optimization, achieving an 82% hit rate in refining SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies. Importantly, it unlocks large-scale analysis of immune repertoires, revealing surprising structural and functional convergence across individuals despite sequence diversity.","Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive success in modeling proteins. However, general-purpose “foundational” PLMs have limited performance in modeling antibodies due to the latter’s hypervariable regions, which do not conform to the evolutionary conservation principles that such models rely on. In this study, we propose a transfer learning framework called Antibody Mutagenesis-Augmented Processing (AbMAP), which fine-tunes foundational models for antibody-sequence inputs by supervising on antibody structure and binding specificity examples. Our learned feature representations accurately predict mutational effects on antigen binding, paratope identification, and other key antibody properties. We experimentally validate AbMAP for antibody optimization by applying it to refine a set of antibodies that bind to a SARS-CoV-2 peptide, and obtain an 82% hit-rate and up to 22-fold increase in binding affinity. AbMAP also unlocks large-scale analyses of immune repertoires, revealing that B-cell receptor repertoires of individuals, while remarkably different in sequence, converge toward similar structural and functional coverage. Importantly, AbMAP’s transfer learning approach can be readily adapted to advances in foundational PLMs. We anticipate AbMAP will accelerate the efficient design and modeling of antibodies, expedite the discovery of antibody-based therapeutics, and deepen our understanding of humoral immunity."
292,"Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning",Computer Sciences,"Motion-sensor cameras in natural habitats offer the opportunity to inexpensively and unobtrusively gather vast amounts of data on animals in the wild. A key obstacle to harnessing their potential is the great cost of having humans analyze each image. Here, we demonstrate that a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence called deep neural networks can automatically extract such invaluable information. For example, we show deep learning can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset while performing at the same 96.6% accuracy of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers. Automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collecting such data could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into “big data” sciences.","Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would improve our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into “big data” sciences. Motion-sensor “camera traps” enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with >93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving >8.4 y (i.e., >17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology. Our results suggest that deep learning could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild."
293,Reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA can integrate into the genome of cultured human cells and can be expressed in patient-derived tissues,Medical Sciences,"An unresolved issue of SARS-CoV-2 disease is that patients often remain positive for viral RNA as detected by PCR many weeks after the initial infection in the absence of evidence for viral replication. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome of the infected cell and be expressed as chimeric transcripts fusing viral with cellular sequences. Importantly, such chimeric transcripts are detected in patient-derived tissues. Our data suggest that, in some patient tissues, the majority of all viral transcripts are derived from integrated sequences. Our data provide an insight into the consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infections that may help to explain why patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery.","Prolonged detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery from COVID-19, but some of these patients do not appear to shed infectious virus. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral–host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3′ end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences."
294,Building transformers from neurons and astrocytes,Computer Sciences,"Transformers have become the default choice of neural architecture for many machine learning applications. Their success across multiple domains such as language, vision, and speech raises the question: How can one build Transformers using biological computational units? At the same time, in the glial community, there is gradually accumulating evidence that astrocytes, formerly believed to be passive house-keeping cells in the brain, in fact play an important role in the brain’s information processing and computation. In this work we hypothesize that neuron–astrocyte networks can naturally implement the core computation performed by the Transformer block in AI. The omnipresence of astrocytes in almost any brain area may explain the success of Transformers across a diverse set of information domains and computational tasks.","Glial cells account for between 50% and 90% of all human brain cells, and serve a variety of important developmental, structural, and metabolic functions. Recent experimental efforts suggest that astrocytes, a type of glial cell, are also directly involved in core cognitive processes such as learning and memory. While it is well established that astrocytes and neurons are connected to one another in feedback loops across many timescales and spatial scales, there is a gap in understanding the computational role of neuron–astrocyte interactions. To help bridge this gap, we draw on recent advances in AI and astrocyte imaging technology. In particular, we show that neuron–astrocyte networks can naturally perform the core computation of a Transformer, a particularly successful type of AI architecture. In doing so, we provide a concrete, normative, and experimentally testable account of neuron–astrocyte communication. Because Transformers are so successful across a wide variety of task domains, such as language, vision, and audition, our analysis may help explain the ubiquity, flexibility, and power of the brain’s neuron–astrocyte networks."
295,The analgesic paracetamol metabolite AM404 acts peripherally to directly inhibit sodium channels,Neuroscience,"Paracetamol (e.g., Tylenol or Panadol) is one of the most widely used pain relievers, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. While previous studies have focused on the effect of its active metabolite AM404 on the central nervous system (CNS), our research reveals that sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system can also generate AM404. We demonstrate that AM404 inhibits pain-specific sodium channels in nociceptive neurons, effectively reducing normal and inflammatory pain. These findings provide insights into paracetamol’s peripheral mechanisms of action and highlight the potential of AM404 as a pain-selective local anesthetic, offering broader implications for pain management strategies.","Paracetamol has been used for decades to relieve mild-to-moderate pain. Its analgesic effect is mainly attributed to its metabolite, AM404, acting on cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels in central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons. It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in naïve and inflamed rats. We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) 1.8 and 1.7 via the local anesthetic binding site. The NaV1.8 and 1.7 inhibition was specific for AM404 and not observed with other metabolites of paracetamol. Our findings suggest that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is mediated mainly by direct AM404-induced inhibition of nociceptive sodium channels at the peripheral nociceptor neurons. Our findings lay a foundation for the potential development of AM404 as a selective local analgesic."
296,Rapid growth of the US wildland-urban interface raises wildfire risk,Environmental Sciences,"When houses are built close to forests or other types of natural vegetation, they pose two problems related to wildfires. First, there will be more wildfires due to human ignitions. Second, wildfires that occur will pose a greater risk to lives and homes, they will be hard to fight, and letting natural fires burn becomes impossible. We examined the number of houses that have been built since 1990 in the United States in or near natural vegetation, in an area known as the wildland-urban interface (WUI), and found that a large number of houses have been built there. Approximately one in three houses and one in ten hectares are now in the WUI. These WUI growth trends will exacerbate wildfire problems in the future.","The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is the area where houses and wildland vegetation meet or intermingle, and where wildfire problems are most pronounced. Here we report that the WUI in the United States grew rapidly from 1990 to 2010 in terms of both number of new houses (from 30.8 to 43.4 million; 41% growth) and land area (from 581,000 to 770,000 km2; 33% growth), making it the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States. The vast majority of new WUI areas were the result of new housing (97%), not related to an increase in wildland vegetation. Within the perimeter of recent wildfires (1990–2015), there were 286,000 houses in 2010, compared with 177,000 in 1990. Furthermore, WUI growth often results in more wildfire ignitions, putting more lives and houses at risk. Wildfire problems will not abate if recent housing growth trends continue."
297,Environmental outcomes of the US Renewable Fuel Standard,Environmental Sciences,"Biofuels are included in many proposed strategies to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and limit the magnitude of global warming. The US Renewable Fuel Standard is the world’s largest existing biofuel program, yet despite its prominence, there has been limited empirical assessment of the program’s environmental outcomes. Even without considering likely international land use effects, we find that the production of corn-based ethanol in the United States has failed to meet the policy’s own greenhouse gas emissions targets and negatively affected water quality, the area of land used for conservation, and other ecosystem processes. Our findings suggest that profound advances in technology and policy are still needed to achieve the intended environmental benefits of biofuel production and use.","The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) specifies the use of biofuels in the United States and thereby guides nearly half of all global biofuel production, yet outcomes of this keystone climate and environmental regulation remain unclear. Here we combine econometric analyses, land use observations, and biophysical models to estimate the realized effects of the RFS in aggregate and down to the scale of individual agricultural fields across the United States. We find that the RFS increased corn prices by 30% and the prices of other crops by 20%, which, in turn, expanded US corn cultivation by 2.8 Mha (8.7%) and total cropland by 2.1 Mha (2.4%) in the years following policy enactment (2008 to 2016). These changes increased annual nationwide fertilizer use by 3 to 8%, increased water quality degradants by 3 to 5%, and caused enough domestic land use change emissions such that the carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher. These tradeoffs must be weighed alongside the benefits of biofuels as decision-makers consider the future of renewable energy policies and the potential for fuels like corn ethanol to meet climate mitigation goals."
298,Reassessing the role of urban green space in air pollution control,"Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences","Our findings indicate that the relationship between urban vegetation and air quality is more complex than previously thought. While urban greening has other positive health outcomes for residents, our study suggests that it may not be an efficient abatement measure for air pollution. Although we found minor amelioration effects of vegetation at the borough to city scale, street-level vegetation can act to exacerbate air pollution. Reducing anthropogenic emissions instead of urban greening should be the primary focus for improving air quality.","The assumption that vegetation improves air quality is prevalent in scientific, popular, and political discourse. However, experimental and modeling studies show the effect of green space on air pollutant concentrations in urban settings is highly variable and context specific. We revisited the link between vegetation and air quality using satellite-derived changes of urban green space and air pollutant concentrations from 2,615 established monitoring stations over Europe and the United States. Between 2010 and 2019, stations recorded declines in ambient NO2, (particulate matter) PM10, and PM2.5 (average of −3.14% y−1), but not O3 (+0.5% y−1), pointing to the general success of recent policy interventions to restrict anthropogenic emissions. The effect size of total green space on air pollution was weak and highly variable, particularly at the street scale (15 to 60 m radius) where vegetation can restrict ventilation. However, when isolating changes in tree cover, we found a negative association with air pollution at borough to city scales (120 to 16,000 m) particularly for O3 and PM. The effect of green space was smaller than the pollutant deposition and dispersion effects of meteorological drivers including precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. When averaged across spatial scales, a one SD increase in green space resulted in a 0.8% (95% CI: −3.5 to 2%) decline in air pollution. Our findings suggest that while urban greening may improve air quality at the borough-to-city scale, the impact is moderate and may have detrimental street-level effects depending on aerodynamic factors like vegetation type and urban form."
299,Differential neural mechanisms underlie cortical gating of visual spatial attention mediated by alpha-band oscillations,Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"Selective attention relies on neural mechanisms involved in target enhancement and distractor suppression to guide behavior. Using electrocorticographic data in humans, we show a spatiotemporal dissociation between cortical activities engaged in target facilitation and distractor inhibition during attentional deployment. We also found that at attended locations, interareal interactions are enhanced through cross-frequency coupling along the visual hierarchy to potentially facilitate the processing of a spatially predictable target. In contrast, at unattended locations, intra-areal interactions are enhanced through cross-frequency coupling, and interareal interactions are suppressed, together to potentially attenuate the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal that such a distributed cortical organization and complementary neural mechanisms enable efficient gating and filtering of sensory information in the anticipatory processing of spatial attention.","Selective attention relies on neural mechanisms that facilitate processing of behaviorally relevant sensory information while suppressing irrelevant information, consistently linked to alpha-band oscillations in human M/EEG studies. We analyzed cortical alpha responses from intracranial electrodes implanted in eight epilepsy patients, who performed a visual spatial attention task. Electrocorticographic data revealed a spatiotemporal dissociation between attention-modulated alpha desynchronization, associated with the enhancement of sensory processing, and alpha synchronization, associated with the suppression of sensory processing, during the cue-target interval. Dorsal intraparietal areas contralateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited a delayed and sustained alpha desynchronization, while ventrolateral extrastriatal areas ipsilateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited an earlier and sustained alpha synchronization. Analyses of cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and broadband high-frequency activity (HFA) further revealed cross-frequency interactions along the visual hierarchy contralateral to the attended locations. Directionality analyses indicate that alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas modulated HFA power in downstream visual areas, thus potentially facilitating the feedforward processing of an upcoming, spatially predictable target. In contrast, in areas ipsilateral to the attended locations, HFA power modulated local alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas, with suppressed interareal interactions, potentially attenuating the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal divergent alpha-mediated neural mechanisms underlying target enhancement and distractor suppression during the deployment of spatial attention, reflecting enhanced functional connectivity at attended locations, while suppressed functional connectivity at unattended locations. The collective dynamics of these alpha-mediated neural mechanisms play complementary roles in the efficient gating of sensory information."
300,Revealing land control dynamics in emerging agricultural frontiers,Environmental Sciences,"The expansion of commodity agriculture is the leading driver of deforestation globally, which makes it crucial that we capture it accurately. Yet the way we monitor agricultural commodity frontiers typically overlooks early dynamics of land claiming that precede deforestation. As a result, agricultural frontiers only become apparent when it is too late. Here, we develop an approach to map land claiming and apply it to the Gran Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot. We reveal that land claiming extends well beyond deforestation fronts and into what would appear like intact forests. Our approach can serve as a tool for the targeting of policies to protect dry woodlands and the many people who depend on them.","The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical and subtropical woodlands degrades ecosystem functionality, biodiversity, and the livelihood base of millions of people. Understanding where and how agricultural frontiers emerge is thus important. Yet, existing monitoring approaches typically focus on mapping deforestation and do not capture the shifts in land access and ownership that lay the ground for agricultural expansion, thereby missing early stages of frontier development. We develop an approach that captures these early dynamics and apply it to the entire 1,1 million km2 of the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot. Through the detection of linear features indicative of land claims and the analysis of their spatial–temporal dynamics, we reveal that the footprint of agricultural frontiers in the region extends far beyond that of deforestation. Most of the Chaco shows signs of land claiming, and although claiming activity is especially concentrated close to active deforestation, emergent claiming in remote parts of the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco indicates rapidly growing interest in land in these regions. Finally, the strong spatial correlation between land claiming and the disappearance of smallholder homesteads points to the social repercussions of early agricultural frontier expansion in the Chaco. By offering a transferable template to map land-control indicators at scale, our approach enables a better understanding of frontier processes and more accurate targeting of policy interventions in emerging agricultural frontiers globally."
